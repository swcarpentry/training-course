The safety checks that can help keep you alive when cleaning a climbing anchor. Not computer-related, but there was one I saw on how plants use water and decided to go off-topic <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Serious disclaimer here: don&#8217;t use this to learn how to clean a climbing anchor. Find a qualified instructor and learn with them (and practice it all on the ground many times beforehand).
