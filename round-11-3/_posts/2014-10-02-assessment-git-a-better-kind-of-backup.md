You just finished editing the file main.py (already tracked by git) and created a new file functions.py that you want git to track. What command(s) will save all these changes to the repository?

1.  <pre>&gt; git commit -a</pre>

2.  <pre>&gt; git add functions.py; git commit</pre>

3.  <pre>&gt; git commit functions.py; git commit main.py</pre>

4.  <pre>&gt; git add functions.py; git commit -a</pre>

You edit the files main.py and functions.py. After editing functions.py, you realize there is only one function left in it, so you rename it function.py. If you run &#8220;git status&#8221; after these changes, which file(s) will be in the &#8220;Changes to be committed&#8221;, which file(s) will be in the &#8220;Changes not staged for commit&#8221;, and which file(s) will be in the &#8220;Untracked files&#8221;?
