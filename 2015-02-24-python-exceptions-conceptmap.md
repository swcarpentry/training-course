I made a concept map showing the relationships between errors, tracebacks, and exceptions in Python.  
The concept map also listed many of the common kinds of exceptions. I used [this lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/07-errors.html).

I mapped the first 2 learning objectives of the lesson. You can view the concept map here:
