## Question 1:

To load a dataset in file `"data.csv"` into a variable `a`, and display on the terminal the maximal value of that dataset you could use:

a) `var a = load("data.csv"); echo maximum(a);`  
b) `a = loadtxt("data.csv"); print max(a);`  
c) `a = numpy.loadtxt("data.csv"); print a.max();`  
d) `var a = numpy.print_maximum("data.csv");`  
e) `a = numpy.load("data.csv"); print max(a);`

## Question 2:

You have just loaded into a variable `data` a matrix of meteorological data for London, England and New York, USA and want to compare the rainfall for March, April, and May.

Given that the matrix is formatted as follows, how would you create a line plot comparing the rainfall statistics?

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Jan
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Feb
    </td>
    
    <td>
      March
    </td>
    
    <td>
      &#8230;
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      NYC-temp
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      NYC-rainfall
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      LON-temp
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      LON-rainfall
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
