I&#8217;m a PhD student at the university of Edinburgh, UK, working in the field of computational astrophysics.  Python and git feature pretty heavily in my day-to-day workflow; having previously attended a bootcamp I&#8217;m keen to help introduce such tools to others, as well as increase my own competency with them.
