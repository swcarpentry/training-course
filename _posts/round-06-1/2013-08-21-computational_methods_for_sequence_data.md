Here&#8217;s a concept map of different ways to analyze sequence data (either DNA or RNA as it&#8217;s all character data in the form of a string) &#8212; the kind from mixed samples from environmental sources.  I had a difficult time deciding on a topic that I could quickly draw out in 10 to 15 minutes &#8212; and going through this exercise really made me organize some concepts in my mind and perhaps changed some of my thoughts on the process of data analysis (or at least how to go about explaining how the data should be analyzed).
