My attempt at the concept map for using numpy.fromfile() to import data from a binary data file (clicking should enlarge).  I had to think a little about having one bubble with many bubbles off of it (the options for fromfile).  I think it turned out OK.  Looking forward to suggestions to make it better.  Thanks!
