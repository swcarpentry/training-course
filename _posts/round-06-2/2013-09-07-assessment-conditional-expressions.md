This was tough, as I&#8217;m not really an expert in anything except mathematics. Ah well. Have some questions on conditional evaluation. 

First question (novice vs competent):

Which value of x will cause the following conditional expression to return &#8220;false&#8221;?

<pre>(x &lt; 10 OR x > 8) AND x > 6</pre>

A. x = 11  
B. x = 9  
C. x = 7  
D. x = 5

Second question (competent vs expert &#8211; sort of):

How many of the individual inequalities below must be evaluated to return an answer for x = 67?

<pre>x > 0 AND (x &lt; 50 OR X &lt; 100) OR (x &lt;20 AND X > 3)</pre>

A. 2  
B. 3  
C. 4  
D. 5
