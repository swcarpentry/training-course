Ok, I know It sounds ridicules. Right now, I live in an English speaking country (Canada) and study here, but believe me or not, I never finished any English classes (you might see that from my grammatical errors). My parents are bilingual so am I. They already speak two languages so they never try to learn English as their third language. I remember, my older sister once tried to learn English and it was so hard for her and she drop it. For me as a child learning English was so scary I never even tried it. During high school, since all my classmates knew english very well, I had this feeling that I am missing something really important and tried to took some English courses. It was horrible experiment for me, It turned out I am really fast learner and English classes were really slow. I remember we should repeat every word and sentences for many times, sometimes many days. I missed lots of classes because I read books in advance and spending time in classes seemed really useless. At the end, I dropped the class. I studied English by my own and then try the more higher level and again it was the same experience, the  learning progress in classes was really slow and teachers never helped to make it more fun or more suitable for me. Therefore, I dropped it again and never took any English class in my life. During time, because I really needed to learn English for my studies, I learned English mostly by myself or my friend’s help. Though, it was after that, I had lots of problem because I did not know English.

What could I do different?

I believe if I could overcome my initial fear of learning new language and start it way sooner, it would help me a lot more. The other point is that, at that time, If I understood how important learning English is for me, I would bear more with class and be more patient. But I was teenager and fool. I was really confident that I could learn it by myself better than class!
