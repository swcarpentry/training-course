Recently I&#8217;ve returned to figuring out how to work efficient with issue tracking system and that is the reason that I&#8217;ve prepared concept map of such system. Of course there is one very important feature that is missing on that map and it is communication with the user about the outcome of every step that issue went in the system. It is just essential if you&#8217;re fighting for user satisfaction. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ven&#8217;t put it in to the map because it would obscure picture.

Feel free to demolish my map .-) and sorry for my bad &#8220;calligraphy&#8221; (or better to say very bad handwriting), they tried to teach me how to write in proper way and get nice output for the most of my life, alas I&#8217;ve been very bad student. Hopefully today we have got these bloody computers on which I could write .-)

PS. Sorry for a bit of delay, but I could always say that recently I&#8217;m working in GMT-11 time zone (see http://xkcd.com/448/). I hope that there won&#8217;t be a case in my future homework .-)
