We had our first online video meeting this afternoon.  13 people took part (three of them voice-only, one text-only) as we walked through [Week 1&#8217;s concept maps][1].

**Observations**

*   Some focused on terms and relationships ([http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2012/09/07/week-1-python-libraries/][2])
*   Others were organized around commands and options ([http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2012/09/07/week-1-the-shell-finding-things/][3])
*   And some were&#8230; minimalist <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> ([http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2012/09/06/week-1-shell-pipes-and-filters/][4])
*   Sometimes hard to think of contrasting/boundary examples (often introduced with words like &#8220;however&#8230;&#8221;)

**Questions**

*   How useful is a concept map if you didn&#8217;t draw it yourself? I.e., is it the artifact, or the process of creating it, that aids learning?
*   How much insight does a concept map give you into someone&#8217;s understanding of a subject? 
    *   How would you grade a concept map?
    *   Do you think a robot could grade a concept map?
*   Where/how do you start explaining things when there are cycles in the concept map?
*   (How) would you use a concept map as a teaching aid?
*   Does everyone who understands something have the same concept map in their heads?

**Wanted:**

*   What are some common pitfalls/misconceptions learners have (they don&#8217;t show up on traditional concept maps)
*   Can we use concept maps to better gauge students&#8217; existing background (what are some other tried and true methods of determining this ourselves?)

Finally, what are some experiments Greg could try out in the two workshops he&#8217;s teaching next (York and Oslo)? Please submit ideas as comments on [Ben&#8217;s blog post][5].
