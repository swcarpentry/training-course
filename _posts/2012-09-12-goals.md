I&#8217;m reading Ken Bain&#8217;s [<cite>What the Best College Teachers Do</cite>][1] [[1][2]], which it&#8217;s prompted me to do what I should have done two weeks ago: lay out concrete goals for this &#8220;course&#8221;. So, by December, I would like us all to have:

1.  created some new material for Software Carpentry that is solidly grounded in best educational practices;
2.  helped others do the same by critiquing and collaborating on their material;
3.  mastered the new-and-improved core content of Software Carpentry [[2][3]];
4.  retro-fitted some pedagogical aids [[3][4]] to some existing material;
5.  helped teach at least one workshop [[4][5]];
6.  organized a workshop yourself to run somewhere in 2013; and
7.  made a few friends (not least so that you don&#8217;t have to deliver said workshop on your own).

Please let me know (in comments) if this is what would be most useful to you, or whether there are other directions that would be more helpful..

  [1] Says many of the same things as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/"><cite>How Learning Works</cite></a>. On the plus side, it&#8217;s shorter, but on the minus side, it gushes a bit in places.

  [2] I have to do this one too, since I don&#8217;t know how to use Git or the IPython Notebook yet.

<p id="3">
  [3] E.g., formative assessments, worked examples, topic summaries, concept maps, and other things we haven&#8217;t encountered yet.
