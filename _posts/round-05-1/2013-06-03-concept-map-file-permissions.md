Here is a relatively complex diagram of (hopefully) most of the concepts relating to (UNIX) file permissions. I don&#8217;t have too much knowledge about how things work in Windows or other environments.

I was really surprised how complex file permissions are. As a learning experience, I found this extremely useful. When I thought &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ll do file permissions&#8221; initially, I thought it would be very basic. As it happens, everything is much more murky.

Some things I was thinking about as I was going along:

*   should I indicate where I am less confident in the relationship. Perhaps doubt could be expressed with grey?
*   including some sort of taxonomy for different concept/node types. In a software course, perhaps commands should be a green oval for the lifetime of the programme. Perhaps this continuity between concept maps could ease learning over time.
*   how do I include examples (are they even concepts?)
*   when do I stop?

I used CmapTools 5.05.01 to develop this map. It is my first time using the tool. I found it quite good, but I found myself wanting to push the boundaries of map quite a bit. The software seems to want to keep the left and top boundary fixed. This meant I ran out of room quite a few times which was annoying.
