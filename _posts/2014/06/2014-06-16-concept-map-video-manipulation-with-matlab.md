The plan was to cover the basics of loading and saving videos in Matlab as well as covering the basic structures in Matlab that allow manipulation of the files.

Apart from realizing I should get a 2H pencil, I have mixed concepts and Matlab commands. I would have preferred better separation between these two areas.

Anyway I look forward to feedback.
