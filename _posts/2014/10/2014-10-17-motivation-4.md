I can post two discouraging but probably very general events, I could not recall any specific event that was discouraging. (My apologize for my rather late post.)  
The first one is about the general &#8220;that is an easy to solve problem&#8221; comment. I think the most discouraging comment to me that I had many times over the course of my academic path (and I still encounter it very often) is the comment that the solution to a problem I stated should be easy. I found it very discouraging when I hear that something should be supposedly &#8220;very easy&#8221; but I have not solved the problem after hours. I think there are two motivations behind this comment 1) people tend to speak &#8220;lightly&#8221; about things they have sometimes not really a clue about, 2) they don&#8217;t have any idea but want to encourage you to try, 3) they know what they are talking about but don&#8217;t know what your level is. My experience tell me that the first is  usually more common. The second and third have a good intention but can be harmful.

As a solution, I started asking to what other problem they compare whether the particular problem is easy or not and try to make a realistic estimation for myself.

The second is about a grant proposal that I had submitted but was given the comment by someone in the committee that I will not get it. Although  
there was no particular reason that the person had to tell me this, he gave me this information during one of our meetings. Afterwards I had to give a presentation to a core committee and was really nervous because I had this comment all the time in my head. At the end, I got the grant after my presentation but to this date I do not know what this person meant by this comment.

The learning I think is not pay attention what others say and not to discourage myself by others comments, which may not be even intentionally stated. (Although not easy.)
