[Byron Weber Becker][1] is an instructor in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. When I asked him for an example of a well-written lesson, he sent me the PDFs attached. The first is the slides for a lesson on polymorphism; the second is the instructor&#8217;s guide for that same lesson. Our existing lessons aren&#8217;t nearly this well organized, but I hope they will be some day.
