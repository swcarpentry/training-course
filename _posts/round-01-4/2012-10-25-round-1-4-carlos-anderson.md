Here&#8217;s the concept map I would use (the topics I didn&#8217;t cover are in pink):

Here&#8217;s a link to the IPython Notebook for the lesson: [File][2] (raw) and [View][3] (nbviewer).

1. To use it, I would have the page printed out next to me as a guide, but start with a completely blank notebook for the students. I would have them follow along with me, likely doing more experimentation as they ask questions or come up with examples.

2. For study outside of class, I would provide the full notebook, which includes my explanations to what is going on. I should probably add links to pages providing more details, including links to the areas of the concept map I didn&#8217;t cover.

3. Being able to interactively run each piece of code provides learners with immediate feedback. IPython doesn&#8217;t have any of the fancy tools Bret had in order to visualize what&#8217;s happening, but I&#8217;ve kept my code snippets small so that they could be understood in chunks. Because I&#8217;d likely be teaching biologists, I included a biology-related example in the end to keep the topic relevant.
