B) [3,4,5,6,7,8]

On looking at this again the following morning, I&#8217;m not completely sure that the second question is quite competent-from-expert (maybe I&#8217;m not enough of an expert!). It certainly is higher-level compared to the first one, which is more of a &#8220;do you remember&#8221; type question.
