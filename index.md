This site is the home of a training course run by [Software Carpentry][1] that teaches scientists how to teach other scientists how to program. In it, we cover the basics of educational psychology and instructional design, and look at how to use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes. This training takes 2-4 hours/week for 12-14 weeks, and is strongly recommended for people who would like to become [Software Carpentry instructors][2].

You don&#8217;t need to be an expert programmer to take part: in fact, we prefer instructors who are only two steps ahead of their learners and can still remember what it&#8217;s like to find programming difficult and confusing. You *do* need to be enthusiastic and willing to volunteer to help teach others what you know, and also willing to abide by our [code of conduct][3].
