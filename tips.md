Keep the lesson script or instructor's notes on a separate screen, such as a tablet.
This way learners aren't distracted by seeing the instructor's notes,
and the instructor doesn't have to switch between screens to see what comes next.
Some people like to use an iPad or tablet for this purpose,
so that the projected screen that the learners can see only contains the live code or instructions for challenges.

If there is the capability for two projected screens,
use one for the live code
and another that shows the example scripts (for reference) or instructions for challenges.
