My intention here was to show the relationship between different programs running in a bash shell. Since bash is designed around the idea of text flow, this diagram relates the programs via text in pipes and text in files. It may be that there shouldn&#8217;t be a &#8220;text&#8221; bubble in the middle, I not sure about that.

I think I may have undertaken too large a task, this got a bit hairy.
