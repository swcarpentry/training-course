Here is my concept map, about using the yield statement in a python function.<figure id="attachment_5508" style="width: 707px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-large wp-image-5508" alt="Concept map about using the yield statement in python functions" src="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Concept-map-1024x723.png" width="707" height="499" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Concept map about using the yield statement in a python function</figcaption></figure> 
The intended audience is people who are already familiar with functions in python (using the return statement), and my goal was to compare and contrast the use of yield versus the use of return.

Comments welcome!
