[apologies for the brevity of this post &#8211; it&#8217;s been a rough couple of weeks&#8230;]

After people made their pitches (which was a lot of fun), we talked about the difference between formative and summative assessment, then took a brief look at [reverse instructional design][1], which is the teaching equivalent of [test-driven development][2]. For our next exercise, I would like you each to come up with two questions or exercises you could use to tell whether or not someone has learned a short topic of your choice. The topic can be the one you made your pitch on, or something else entirely, but should be something you could teach in 10-15 minutes. One of the two questions must be a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with 4-5 answers (all of which should be plausible, only one of which should be right). The second can be any other kind of question or exercise, provided it&#8217;s something people could do in a few minutes at the end of a lesson.

Please do *not* post the answers to your questions. Instead, please try to answer several other people&#8217;s MCQ&#8217;s, and give them feedback on how clear the question was. If you&#8217;re suffering from writer&#8217;s block, please have a look at [these submissions from previous cohorts][3].

There is no assigned chapter from *How Learning Works* this time around. Instead, I would like you to have a look at these four papers&mdash;we&#8217;ll be exploring these topics, and others, in the final rounds.

1.  Guzdial: [Why Is It So Hard to Learn to Program?][4]
2.  Crouch & Mazur: [Peer Instruction: Ten Years of Experience and Results][5]
3.  Labaree: [The Winning Ways of a Losing Strategy: Educationalizing Social Problems in the United States][6]
4.  Whitecraft & Williams: [Why Aren&#8217;t More Women in Computer Science?][7]
