In a directory I have the following files with Messier object (M) data and NGC data. Any data which has been altered is marked with an &#8216;a&#8217;.  
M01.txt  
M41.txt  
M81.txt  
M81a.txt  
M101.tbl  
M105.txt  
M105a.txt  
M107.txt  
NGC4791.txt  
NGC4791a.txt  
NGC6371.txt

1)I want a list of data for only objects with messier numbers 100 or greater, without alterations. Which of the following commands will produce such a list?  
a) ls *  
b) ls M1*.txt  
c) ls M1?.txt  
d) ls M1??.*

2) say I want to get the line count from each of the files selected in problem 1, what command could I run to achieve this? How could I redirect that information into a file?

Sorry for any formatting issues, I&#8217;m having to do this from my mobile phone.
