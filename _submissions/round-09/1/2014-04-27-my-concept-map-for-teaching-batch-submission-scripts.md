my NSCCS users require these scripts to submit their calculations on our supercomputer.

They need about 20 UNIX commands. I prefer to teach them wit nano to start with and we submit from the command line. Once the get tired of this batch script I teach them awk to generate a submission on the fly. Once they get tired of nano I show them vi.
