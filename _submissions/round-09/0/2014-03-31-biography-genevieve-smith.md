I'm a postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin, where I also did my PhD, in Ecology, Evolution & Behavior. I spent a lot of my time in graduate school teaching statistics and developing course materials for UT's Division of Statistics & Scientific Computation, where I also became involved with stats consulting for faculty and students in several other departments.
