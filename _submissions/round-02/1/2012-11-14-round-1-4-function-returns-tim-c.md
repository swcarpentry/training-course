Attached is a draft concept map for the topic of function returns.

Also attached is a link to a draft iPython notebook with some illustrative examples relating to function returns. There are some typos and some messy wording &#8211; &#8211; I will address those as I incorporate comments from others.

Any/all comments most welcome.

For what it&#8217;s worth, I had no problems installing and running the IP[y]: Notebook, embedding inline matplotlib plots, using markdown, etc.I am running Mac OS X Mountain Lion on a new-ish macbook air, and have the basic EPD free iPython installed.

I can envision teaching from an IP[y] notebook without problems

-BUT-

that assumes that all students have things up and running on their end so they can follow along.

Another  approach would be toggling between a text editor and iPython running in a Terminal window. I tried to keep all examples small enough to be visible in one screen. In the extreme, students could copy and paste from whatever editor they have handy into terminal iPython &#8212; it seems to handle pasted line breaks correctly.
