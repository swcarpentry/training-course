Here's the concept map I would use (the topics I didn't cover are in pink):

Here's a link to the IPython Notebook for the lesson: [File][2] (raw) and [View][3] (nbviewer).

1. To use it, I would have the page printed out next to me as a guide, but start with a completely blank notebook for the students. I would have them follow along with me, likely doing more experimentation as they ask questions or come up with examples.

2. For study outside of class, I would provide the full notebook, which includes my explanations to what is going on. I should probably add links to pages providing more details, including links to the areas of the concept map I didn't cover.

3. Being able to interactively run each piece of code provides learners with immediate feedback. IPython doesn't have any of the fancy tools Bret had in order to visualize what's happening, but I've kept my code snippets small so that they could be understood in chunks. Because I'd likely be teaching biologists, I included a biology-related example in the end to keep the topic relevant.
