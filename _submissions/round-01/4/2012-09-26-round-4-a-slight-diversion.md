For our fourth round, we&#8217;re going to take a look at some teaching tools. To get started, please go to [Mark Guzdial&#8217;s blog][1] and look at everything he has posted since [January 2, 2012][2]. Half the articles are fairly ephemeral (conference announcements and the like), but I think the rest will give you a very good overview of the state of the computing education landscape. Once you&#8217;ve done that (which I expect will take a couple of hours), please:

1.  Watch Bret Victor&#8217;s [&#8220;Inventing on Principle&#8221; video][3].
2.  Read his [&#8220;Learnable Programming&#8221; essay][4].
3.  And then read commentary by [Mark Guzdial][5] and [Neil Brown][6].

Using all of that, and what you&#8217;ve learned in the previous three rounds, your task is to create a short lesson on something of your choice using the IPython Notebook. Your lesson should start with a small concept map (but not as small as [Matt Davis&#8217;s][7] <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> with the one key idea you&#8217;re teaching at the center, and half a dozen related ideas that you&#8217;re *not*  around it. At the bottom, please include a brief explanation of:

1.  how you would use the notebook in front of a class when teaching live;
2.  how learners would go through it on their own outside of class; and
3.  how your use of the IPython Notebook relates to one or more of the things you encountered in Mark&#8217;s blog or Bret Victor&#8217;s demo and essay.

Please post your results by Thursday, October 25, and we&#8217;ll discuss them in an online meeting on Monday, October 29.

And looking ahead: in our fifth and final round, I will ask you to make a video of yourself teaching your lesson in front of a handful of people, and post it to [Smarter Cookie][8] for feedback.
