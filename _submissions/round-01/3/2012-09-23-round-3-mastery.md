In this round, we&#8217;re going to try to reach consensus on what &#8220;mastery&#8221; of the Software Carpentry material actually means. We&#8217;ll do this by synthesizing a handful of questions that sum up what our learners actually want to learn, then figure out what their answers are as novices, as competent practitioners, and as experts.

**Step 1:** please read the following:

*   Chapter 4 of <cite>How Learning Works</cite>;
*   the [competence matrix][1] essay on the Software Carpentry site; and
*   the [Systematic Curriculum Design][2] post on the same site.

**Step 2:** working on your own, come up with 6-12 questions that summarize what we&#8217;re trying to help our learners do. My eight are:

1.  How can I manage this data?
2.  How can I process it?
3.  How can I tell if I&#8217;ve processed it correctly?
4.  How can I find and fix bugs when I haven&#8217;t?
5.  How can I keep track of what I&#8217;ve done?
6.  How can I find and use other people&#8217;s work?
7.  How can other people find and use mine?
8.  How can I do all these things faster?

but I&#8217;m not satisfied with them (as you can probably guess from how poorly they and the core content map onto each other, as summarized in the [curriculum design][2] blog post). In order to make your intentions clear, please explain what you expect a complete beginner, a competent intermediate, and an expert to do in answer to each question. For example:

> 1.  How can I keep track of what I&#8217;ve done? 
>     *   Novice: keep a written lab notebook.
>     *   Intermediate: save output of &#8220;history&#8221; command to a shell script.
>     *   Expert: have all tools record parameters and version numbers in all output files.

Please post your questions on the blog by **Thursday, September 27**.

**Step 3:** working in small groups, consolidate your individual ideas to produce one list per group. Please post your consolidated question lists by **Thursday, October 4**. Groups are:

Group 1 (Neon Carrot): Carlos Anderson, Erik Bray, Ben Waugh

Group 2 (Wild Watermelon): Justin Ely, Emily Jane McTavish, Sarah Supp

Group 3 (Atomic Tangerine): Katy Huff, Justin Kitzes, Lynne Williams

Group 4 (Electric Lime): Aron Ahmadia, Azalee Bostroem, Becky Stewart
