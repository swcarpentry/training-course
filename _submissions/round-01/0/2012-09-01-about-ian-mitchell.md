Ian Mitchell is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. He has a broad background &#8212; holding degrees in engineering physics, computer science and computational mathematics &#8212; and is interested in better ways of using algorithmic thinking in all fields of science and engineering.  Ian typically teaches courses in numerical methods, although he has designed and taught a CS1 course for students in the life sciences and a graduate course (with Dhavide Aruliah) on reproducible research.  He usually programs in Matlab, but Python is a fun alternative.  His research focuses on the use of numerical algorithms in formal verification, optimal control, robotics and dynamic implicit surfaces.  More information can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell" target="_blank">Ian&#8217;s homepage</a>.
