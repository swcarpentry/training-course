Ugh, this was harder than I thought it would be.  Distinguishing between experts and novices after just 10 minutes based on the same material is challenging.

Novice:

Q:  Which of the following git commands changes your git history?

1.  git commit
2.  git diff
3.  git log
4.  git show

Expert

Q:  Which pair of commands are most useful for looking for or understanding changes that have not yet been committed?

1.  git diff and git log
2.  git show and git log
3.  git diff and git status
4.  git blame and git diff
5.  git show and git commit
