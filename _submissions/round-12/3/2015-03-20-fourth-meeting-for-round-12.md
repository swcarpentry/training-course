**Assignment:**

1.  Write a short blog post describing something that happened in your schooling that demotivated you,
    and discuss what could have been done afterward to fix it.
    -   Add the file to `_submissions/round-12/3/yyyy-mm-dd-firstname-lastname.md`
    -   Use `/2015/03/firstname-lastname-motivation/` as the permalink
    -   Use `Motivation` as one of the tags
2.  Fill in <http://doodle.com/7w9vyq7mhncqzc7t#table> to let Greg know what time zone you're in
    so that he can put you in a group of three for teaching practice.
3.  Do at least one online teaching session with your group (preferably two).
    -   Each person picks something from the [existing lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)
        that they can teach in 5 minutes.
        -   Note: most of Software Carpentry's lessons take longer than this,
            so pick a subsection that you think will fit into this time.
        -   Note also: 5 minutes really means "5 minutes"...
    -   Use Skype or Google Hangout to screenshare while talking.
    -   Each person teaches while live coding for 5 minutes, then their partners spend 5 minutes giving feedback.
    -   Then the next person, then the next.
4.  Read:
    -   Chapters 3 and 4 of *How Learning Works*
    -   the [teaching tips](/training-course/tips/) section of this website.
5.  Greg will send a note separately about Git/GitHub/Markdown tutorials to those who signed up.

**Questions**

-   What did you learn about your topic (and how to teach it) from
    thinking through your MCQ?
-   What did you learn about your topic and/or about writing MCQs from
    the comments you got?
-   What did you learn about writing MCQs and/or giving feedback from
    looking at other people's?

**10:00 Eastern**

-   Greg Wilson (Software Carpentry Foundation)
-   Filipe Fernandes: No post
    -   My topic was python conditionals and I learned that the topic is
        trickier than I first though. (I actually found a bug in
        Shapely's logic after creating the MCQ.)
    -   No feedback (No post).
    -   I learned that teaching how to reverse a list can be more useful
        than I imagine. And how they :: can be confusing.
-   Daniel Wheeler:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/daniel-wheeler-mcq/>
    -   Differentiate between pipes and passing result of commands with
        $(...)
    -   The level of abstraction when phrasing the question. Difficult
        issue. Make it specific or abstract.
    -   Make it possible for the student to implement the question in a
        program at the command line quickly so they can experiment if
        they don't understand it. Useful for me when reading other's
        questions.
-   Marios Isaakidis:
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/marios-isaakidis-mcq/>
    -   Finding misconceptions helped me think of what could confuse
        students and what I should clarify during the workshop
    -   Giving options at the MCQ that refer to concepts out of the
        scope of the course might be misleading
    -   Giving datasets or results of commands can help "simulate" a
        real world scenario
-   Stephanie Mark (University of
    Toronto)<http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/stephanie-mark-mcq/>
    -   helped me think about the concepts behind what I was doing: unix
        commands has become automatic for me so I had to think hard
        about what a person new to unix might be thinking
    -   questions were better received than I thought they would be! and
        that there are better ways to ask the same question
    -   I'm more comfortable receiving feedback than giving it
-   Pawel Pomorski (University of Waterloo)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/pawel-pomorski-mcq/>
    -   Just general understanding that variable assignment is not
        trivial, and might be confusing to someone who has never done
        programming before
    -   Writing good MCQs is difficult, coming up with more than a few
        options which are actually of use to the student and instructor
        is hard
    -   Review by a second person always improves the questions
-   Pandurang Kolekar (University of Pune, India)
-   John Constable (Welcome Trust Sanger Institute)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/john-constable-mcq/>
-   Kai Yang (U. of Washington)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/kai-yang-mcq/>
    -   I learned how to evaluate prior/posterior knowledge.
    -   Unfortunately, I did not receive any feedback.
    -   For the topic itself, I learned nothing from it although I spent
        much time in iterating versions of my MCQ before I pick up an
        appropriate one.
    -   I particularly paid attention to the distraction in the MCQ,
        whether intended or not. Those can give us hints about potential
        misconceptions.
-   Laura Graham (University of Nottingham)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/laura-graham-mcq/>
    -   That I probably don't have a good idea of common misconceptions
        (it was difficult to think of distractors) and that by
        understanding these it might make me a better coder.
    -   One comment suggested that I could be biasing the response
        against one of the wrong answers because it was so obviously
        different from the others - it's difficult to come up with
        distractors which are diagnosable, but also don't bias the
        answers.
    -   I was more likely to offer feedback on shorter, well formatted
        questions, which suggests that these types of questions are most
        likely easier to answer (and therefore more useful as a
        diagnostic tool?)
-   Heather Gibling
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/heather-gibling-mcq/>
    -   I realized a good way to learn about how to teach a topic is to
        think about what I struggled with when learning it myself. (only
        had to think back ~1.5 years)
    -   Things that I think are clear might not be to others. Helpful to
        have feedback
    -   Simpler is better--I found I got tripped up in details in other
        people's questions that distracted a bit from what I should be
        focusing on. Also, I was much more inclined to read through and
        attempt the simpler questions than the long/detailed/complicated
        ones... less intimidating, especially on topics that are not my
        strengths.
-   Amy Boyle (Washington State University Vancouver)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/amy-boyle-mcq/>
    -   I learned different ways people might think about python
        indexing that makes sense, but would be wrong, that I hadn't
        thought of before
    -   I had only positive feedback, so I suppose I learned writing MCQ
        is not as difficult as I thought
    -   The quality and approach of the questions varied greatly, some I
        found kind of confusing, some were good; I could see how the MCQ
        as a tool could be an aid if it's good, or probably demotivating
        if its bad.
-   Adam Richie-Halford (University of Washington)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/adam-richie-halford-mcq/>
    -   Writing the MCQs gave me a better understanding of the improper
        conceptual connections that novices can make. e.g. the syntax of
        piping commands can get in the way of the concept of piping
        commands. We're trying to teach new concepts in a new language.
    -   I didn't receive any comments.
    -   I learned that writing a good MCQ can be very challenging. I
        spent about 45 minutes writing two questions. When I told my
        friends about this they were very surprised at the low question
        output. I'm guessing that it gets easier with time. But I'm also
        guessing that good, productive questions might just take a lot
        longer than everyone thinks.
-   Michael Sarahan (Nion Co)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/michael-sarahan-mcq/>
    -   Coming up with MCQs that were single-topic was very hard. Much
        easier to talk about procedures, but then those felt like they
        expected too much.
    -   The comments pointed out a good error I had made - the question
        I wrote was invalid. I think formatting issues in my post (i
        didn't do the numbered list properly) prevented people from
        giving more feedback, because the question was hard to look at.
    -   Other people often had very long, involved questions. That
        reinforced my belief that questions need to be short and
        single-topic.
-   Karl Broman (UW-Madison)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/karl-broman-mcq/>
    -   I really had to choose the topic to match what I could write an
        MCQ about rather than being able to write an MCQ for a random
        topic of importance. The MCQ exercise really hammered home the
        importance of my understanding what students' misconceptions and
        difficulties might be. I have surprisingly little understanding
        of what are the important mistakes that students might be making
        for many topics.
    -   It was nice to get some positive feedback, and a sense that
        others have the same difficulty with this exercise that I did,
        but I don't think I learned much particularly from the feedback.
    -   Some others were really good at this. Looking at a lot of nice
        MCQs was really helpful for thinking about what I might have
        done, or what I should do next.
-   Owen Stephens (Owen Stephens Consulting) GMT until 29th March, then
    GMT+1 (No post) (sorry :()
    -   You have to know your topic very well, but at same time you need
        to understand the assumptions about existing knowledge
    -   Writing MCQs that target specific knowledge and enable you to
        understand the students understanding through incorrect answers
        is very challenging - ruling out what the incorrect assumptions
        might be is impossible so need to have some baseline
    -   I had to understand something of the area to give feedback, but
        knowing too much could be a disadvantage - I felt I was able to
        give the best feedback where I was a 'good student' level rather
        than an expert level - back to points about baseline assumptions
        above. Also much easier to give feedback on the MCQs than to
        write good ones of my own!
    -   Time: Haven't posted but 1+ hour even so
-   Daiva Nielsen (University of Toronto) - No post on SWC Training
    Course Repo, but this is a link to the MCQ on my own github -- I was
    very late getting these up and didn't submit a PR since late
    submissions weren't merged.
    <https://github.com/daivanielsen/training-course/blob/gh-pages/_submissions/round-12/2/2015-03-18-daiva-nielsen-mcq.md>
    -   I understand commands in Unix Shell a lot better now and how the
        Shell is very useful for easily navigating your way through your
        files and directories.
    -   N/A
    -   It was good to think about the Distractors and the purposes they
        serve. Now I have a greater appreciation for the way that
        understanding why an option is *incorrect* helps with learning.
-   Meredith Durbin (Space Telescope Science Institute):
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/meredith-durbin-mcq/>
    -   MCQs are a lot harder to write than they look
    -   It was easiest to approach it for me by thinking about some of
        the misconceptions I had when I started working with my topic,
        and how I unlearned those; however, other people may have had
        very different initial misconceptions than my own
    -   I saw several good MCQs that were fairly complex in what they
        addressed, and several good ones that were very simple; there
        are multiple ways to create good MCQs
-   Jessica Gallinger (University of Saskatchewan): No post
-   Narayanan Raghupathy
    (<http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/narayanan-raghupathyr-mcq/)>
    -   Writing good MCQs are difficult :)
    -   Had to choose the familiar topic to write good MCQs.
    -   Even after covering for all bases (supposedly), there is always
        better way to write MCQs
-   Javier Garcia Algarra (UPM)
    (<http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/javier-garcia-algarra-mcq/)>
-   R. Burke Squires (NIAID) No post
    -   The topic can be difficult to understand - python programming
    -   Difficult to think of how someone would misunderstand the
        concepts
    -   Good MCQ take a long time to write and think about
-   Matthew Bourque (Space Telescope Science Institute)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/matthew-bourque-mcq/>
    -   I learned that python strings are immutable :) Also, trying to
        come up with distractors made me view the topic in a whole
        different way; it made me consider all aspects of the problem.
    -   That I probably could have made my questions a bit more complex
        and that would have been OK.
    -   Questions can be improved by simple criticism. Also, some MCQs
        test the student's memorization while others test the student's
        ability to reason/deduce.

**15:00 Eastern**

-   Greg Wilson (Software Carpentry Foundation)
-   Phil Rosenfield:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/phil-rosenfield-mcq/>
    -   I learned that I don't have the correct vocabulary when it comes
        to programming.
    -   That I made the mistake of covering in the MCQ what I wanted to
        have seen covered in the lesson (oops!)
    -   I am a better editor than writer!
-   John Pormann
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/john-pormann-mcq/>
    -   To state the obvious: I learned that writing MCQs is hard; and
        it is easy to get tripped up by natural language (words/phrases)
        that sound clear (and unique) but then get interpreted many
        different ways
    -   I was expecting a bit more "high level" responses, but got
        lower-level ones .. which is probably good since we're targeting
        novice programmers
    -   Comp-sci allows for many different ways of doing anything ..
        which complicates how to teach it (but also makes it fun!)
-   Sarah W:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/sarah-w-mcq>
    -   I learned that it is very hard to create meaningful MCQs and
        that made me view my topic differently.
    -   That it's a difficult topic, and it's hard to write good
        analytical MCQs when you yourself are still learning your topic.
    -   It was great to see other examples and see the different takes
        on MCQs.
-   Matt Dickenson:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/matt-dickenson-mcq/>
-   Arliss Collins:
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/arliss-collins-mcq/>
    -   Although my topic was something I was familiar with I did have
        try to read through the lesson material as if I was a new
        learner to the topic in order to figure out what might be
        challenging to a new learner.
    -   The assignment was very interesting. There were portions of the
        lesson that I needed to read a couple of times to make sure I
        understood them enough to teach them. I hope we can still make
        comments on the MCQ's for a bit longer so that we have time to
        look through all of the material
    -   Coming up with good, relevant distractors takes a bit of
        thought - and then to know if they were thought-provoking for
        the learner.
-   Catherine Devlin:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/catherine-devlin-mcq/>
    -   I'd never before thought of a cartesian join as
        the *fundamental* join and everything else as a variant on
        that (b/c after all cartesian joins are generally an error), but
        I realized that's a clear way to think about it
    -   Got a good reminder to be super-careful with the vocabulary used
        in questions. It's all too easy to assume I'm writing clearly
        because I already know what I mean.
    -   There's such a sharp divide between MCQs for remembering
        terminology and MCQs for understanding logic that they almost
        deserve different names
-   Tessa Pierce:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/tessa-pierce-mcq/>
    -   It's fairly difficult to write good, clear MCQ's.
    -   People came up with additional distractors that would help
        diagnose issues with python lists and errors.
    -   Giving feedback: It's easy to see how something was clear in
        somebody's mind, but very difficult to interpret for someone
        else. It is hard to create simple examples that don't require a
        ton of reading or code before getting to the actual
        learning/assessment component.
-   Morgan Taschuk No post
    -   I actually didn't find it too hard to make the questions... but
        then I have no feedback yet so my questions are possibly
        complete crap. :)
    -   No feedback
-   Ariel Bowers
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/ariel-bowers-mcq/>
    -   I learned that it is difficult to create multiple choice
        questions for novice programmers. Simplicity is key and you can
        loss sight of that sometimes.
    -   I learned that everyone doesn't see the same things you see.
    -   Giving feedback can be is difficult.
-   Sarah Mount (University of Wolverhampton)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/sarah-mount-mcq/>
    -   Some corner cases in git - e.g. if two users make identical
        changes to the same branch on the same repo and push to the same
        remote the second push will be rejected.
    -   How difficult it is to write a clear and unambiguous question /
        answer about really detailed bits of syntax
    -   It's difficult to think of really good "wrong" answers and think
        through all the relevant options. In some cases it was
        interesting to see what possibilities people had left out of
        their MCQs.
-   Donna Henderson
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/donna-henderson-mcq/>
    -   I learned that you need a specific idea in mind for each
        question. You can't test too much knowledge with a single
        question
    -   I learned the importance of thinking through your phrasing.
        Something that you've written can easily be interpretted
        differently by someone else
    -   Others thought of good distractors that I never would have come
        up with. Highlights the reason to collaborate on lessons
-   Sue McClatchy (The Jackson Laboratory)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/sue-mcclatchy-mcq/>
    -   I would second the comment about lacking proper vocabulary. I
        thought I knew the language of computer science, but now know
        that the terminology doesn't roll of the tongue so easily.
    -   I submitted my MCQs late and didn't receive comments. My bad.
    -   I discovered how difficult it actually is to write a good
        question. It seems very simple when you've taken so many
        multiple choice exams and quizzes, however, writing a good one
        is not easy or straightforward.
-   Sarah Stevens (University of Wisconsin - Madison) :
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/sarah-stevens-mcq/>
    -   I learned that some of the basics behind my topic could easily
        be confusing, as it was tough to design a question which would
        cover many of the possible misconceptions
    -   I actually learned that if writing a question that purposely
        uses broken code, you should state it in the question. My
        comments were more about correcting the code than the question.
    -   I found it was much more difficult to create a good MCQ than I
        expected. I found it really interesting to see the logic behind
        other people's plausible distractors.
-   Malvika Sharan (University of Wuerzburg, Germany):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/malvika-sharan-mcq/>
    -   Keep the general confusions in mind a student might have about
        the topic so that you can really find out if they really learnt
        the correct concept
    -   Getting second opinion helps alot in thinking more logically
    -   It was interesting to learn that we all have different points of
        view about the same/similar concept and even writing a wrong
        answer needs to have a logical explanantion
-   Jon Borrelli (Stony Brook University):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/jon-borrelli-mcq/>
    -   Coming up with answers with useful distractors was hard.
        Especially when picking something from an earlier lesson it was
        difficult to remember the misconceptions I had when I learned
        it.
    -   It was reassuring when people thought the question and answers
        were useful.
    -   The structure of the MCQ does not have to follow a specific
        format. I saw some interesting implementation of questions and
        distractors. Especially with asking how to do something and
        providing different code that may be able to do the task.
-   Laurie Baker (University of Glasgow):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/laurie-baker-mcq/>
    -   I realise from the comments now that I made mine rather long.
    -   it was hard to think about what size chunk to break off for an
        mcq
-   Francisco Navarro (University of Alicante, Spain):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/franz-navarro-mcq/>
    -   My topic was specially hard for me. Thinking the right questions
        and looking through the doc helped me to really understand and
        therefore, be able to explain the topic.
    -   That is a hard topic for beginners (so it was for me!)
    -   Very nice ideas, and respectful comments that really improved
        most of them (if not all).
-   Joseph Long (Space Telescope Science Institute):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/joseph-long-mcq/>
    (I may be a little late calling in, as I have another meeting ending
    right at 15:00 EDT.)
    -   A1 & 2: I learned that the examples I would use to illustrate
        certain concepts rely (perhaps too much) on background knowledge
        of the topic.
    -   A3: I was happy with my MCQs, but it was not easy to come up
        with them. I think I would improve with practice, and with
        experience seeing the ways in which students misunderstand.
-   Arvind sundaram (Norwegian Sequecing Centre): No post
    -   MCQs would help in getting feedback from the students
    -   None
    -   Extremely difficult to create MCQs unless you had interacted
        with students in a given topic. This would have given an
        overview of mistakes made by students
-   Kim Moir (Mozilla):
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/kim-moir-mcq/>
    -   To think of scenarios where the students could get off track and
        identify the misunderstanding
    -   No comments received
    -   The examples I looked at - most people had a really good grasp
        of their topic.
-   Ben Weinstein (Stony Brook University)
-   Johan Hjelm (Technical University of Denmark)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/johan-hjelm-mcq/>
    -   MCQs are harder than I expected. Regarding the topic, I think
        the process of trying to think of possible misconceptions made
        it a bit clearer to me how dataframes work,
    -   Not so many comments but the one I got helped me see how easy it
        is to cause confusion if it is not written well.
    -   There was a lot of constructive feedback given, and it is
        difficult to construct good distractors of great diagnostic
        value
-   John Constable (Welcome Trust Sanger Institute)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/john-constable-mcq/>
    -   I learned how hard it is to write a question that doesn't lead
        on the reader, and quite how well you need to understand your
        subject..
    -   About the topic I started to get an idea of how people might
        think about the subject, hard breaking out of expertise.
    -   I only managed to give one set of feedback because I found doing
        so incredibly hard - providing useful, constructive feedback
        when you're not a subject expert yourself. Hard not to default
        to only critical mode, which isn't helpful.
-   Konrad Förstner (University of Würzburg, Germany) Konrad Förstner
    (University of Würzburg, Germany)
    -   The topic (Shell Pipes and Filters) was rather clear to me but
        it took me very long to think about potential misconceptions
        (going back to "incompetence") and drafting questions that can
        asses those.
    -   I used "tr" in one of my examples and that seem to be not as
        widely known as I thought
    -   I learned that there are very different perspective of the
        chosen topics. I would have done most of the question with a
        complete different focus but can understand why people did it
        the way they did it. Even those rather simple lessons contain
        numerous traps that can be addressed by those MCQ.
-   Remi Daigle (University of Toronto)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/remi-daigle-mcq/>
    -   I didn't know you could write a one-liner custom function
        without using curly brackets in R
    -   I think the comments really highlighted the importance of
        maintaining consistent formatting between the MCQs and the
        lessons. It really minimizes potential confusion
    -   It's much easier to improve someone else's questions than your
        own, it's often hard to see your own mistakes
-   Dirk Eddelbuettel
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/dirk-eddelbuettel-mcq/>
    -   MCQs are hard, and reasonably difficult to do well. But they
        also help to delineate subtle distinctions, so they are useful.
        Unclear, though, how they help us in the SWC classroom.
    -   The comments were somewhat incisive, and I agreed with at least
        a good part of them -- but they did not really shed too much new
        light on the issue.
    -   A variety of different approaches and angles, and it helps to
        see them.
-   Derek Howard:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/derek-howard-mcq/>
    -   I learned how easy it is to confuse a potential student
    -   Comments were helpful to minimize confusion for new learners who
        would be answering the question.
    -   Coming up with relevant distractor answers which can help
        diagnose misconceptions is difficult
-   Andrew MacDonald
    -   I learned that R functions do partial argument matching, which
        I didn't know. However, after a bit of discussion in the
        comments I'm now of the opinion that we should not even be
        teaching that particular fact :P
    -   I learned that writing multiple choice questions is REALLY
        RATHER HARD. The only person who attempted my question answered
        it *incorrectly*, despite her own understanding of the topic,
        because I presented it poorly. Also, one commenter pointed out
        that some of my answers aren't really likely points of
        confusion for students, and are thus not too helpful.
    -   From looking at other people's questions, I think this is
        rather common. It's really hard for an expert to imagine what a
        novice might think, and inevitably at least one of the
        distractors is an answer that would only be given by somebody
        who either wasn't paying attention or who didn't understand
        either math or English.
-   John Moreau (University of Missouri, Kansas-City)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/john-moreau-mcq/>
    -   I choose to write questions about different object types in
        R. As I developed my questions, I learned how many different
        concepts a student would need to really understand this
        idea.
    -   I learned how my understanding of my topic relies on my
        implicit connections among different concepts. Several
        commenters pointed out that one of my questions was a bit
        longer and would be more difficult to do without expert
        knowledge or running the code in R. I could interpret the
        question and think through the right answer, however novice
        learners might not be able to do so.
    -   It was interesting to see how people came at similar topics
        based on their experience. One person specifically included
        a distractor based on the differences between R and other
        languages. I thought that was a good consideration.
-   Martin Bentley
    -   I need to actually consider what is the most important piece
        of understanding to take away from a
        section/course/question. This will affect what and how to
        ask things.
    -   That sometimes more questions are not always better. A
        choice of two good questions might be better than 4 ok ones.
    -   This is much harder than it seems. Also, to make the
        question clear is important, it is very easy to make
        something overly complicated, and just confuse people,
        rather than make them think about the question.

-   Greg Wilson (Software Carpentry Foundation)
-   Kristopher Keipert (IAState)
    -   The logic of the grep tags can be easily obsucated and produce
        unclear results
    -   Most of the SWC curriculum on grep can be covered by evaluating
        useage of grep tags
    -   It can be difficult to think of 3/4 alternate but feasible
        trains of thought which lead to incorrect answers.
-   Elizabeth Wickes (UIUC)
    -   I remembered going through the same mistakes as a beginner and
        same anger of "why!?"
    -   I learned that I need to put in more errors
    -   It is hard to go back to the beginner mindset because we've all
        worked so hard to reframe our logical constructs to live and
        breath how we know that programming world to work.
-   Will Cornwell:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/will-cornwell-mcq/>
    -   Sorry I missed out. Turns out daylight savings time switches at
        different times in different countries, very confusing
    -   I learned that scoping is best taught in multiple steps,
        especially the weird way that R does it
    -   Learned that writing multiple choice question is an art,
        especially coming up with many plausible wrong answers
    -   Good to think about the materials (esp help files) available for
        students when you give them MCQ's
-   Richard Tomsett (OIST):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/richard-tomsett-mcq/>
    -   Apologies for missing this - forgot about daylight savings!
        Answer to Q: I learned that a simple SQL statement can be really
        quite powerful, and also very speicific - it was hard coming up
        with distractors I thought weren't too obvious
    -   I learned it can be difficult not to make MCQs leading. And
        about SQL, that a beginner's problem is often understanding what
        you'll actually get back from a SELECT query
    -   People have very varied styles! I Also saw several different
        ways to go about asking (give a code snippet and ask what it
        does, or describe an outcome then give choices of code snippets
        that do it).
-   Brian Magill (SSAI):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/brian-magill-mcq/>
    -   From preparing my own MCQ's I learned how difficult it is to
        come up with responses that discern different misconceptions
        students might have. The other issue was to avoid writing
        tricky questions that simply measure cleverness instead of
        assessing comprehension.
    -   As of Tuesday no one had left any comments on my MCQ's. (I did
        not check yesterday evening.)
    -   One thing I found by looking at other people's MCQ's is that
        there is only so much content one can put in a single question
        and its corresponding responses. Sometimes you need more than
        one MCQ (to avoid student's narrowing responses due to process
        of elimination.)
-   Jeremy Gray (U of Toronto):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/jeremy-gray/>
    -   already had a good understanding of scoping, but thinking of how
        people might get it wrong helped out a lot
    -   People will not always know the surrounding functions you use -
        testing one thing might require extremely simplified versions of
        other things - specifically, c() and rm. "https everywhere"
        browser extension breaks disqus, and makes you think you got no
        comments.
    -   Writing sensible mcqs is hard- you need to have a good
        understanding of exactly how your students will think.
-   Luke Johnston (U of Toronto)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/luke-johnston-mcq/>
    -   I learned more about how SQL deals with missingness... which is
        very different from how R or SAS deals with them. I also learned
        how useful a well designed MCQ is for getting information from
        the students!
    -   I learned from the comment that it is hard to write a clear
        question
    -   Writing a good MCQ is hard. Takes quite a bit of time and mental
        thought! Based on others MCQ, I learned that formatting (for
        mutli-line responses) for MCQ are very important. Plus, from
        reading others' MCQs I really saw how useful they can be to
        diagnose problems, including my own misconceptions about a
        question!
-   Vladimir Sudilovsky (NASA/ADS)

    -   How to properly construct a MCQ that tests "common" or expected
        misconceptions
    -   That my assumption that the two questions should be read
        together (as one) was not necessarily valid
    -   MCQs are not very easy to construct
-   Matthew Collins (U of Florida)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/matthew-collins-mcq/>
    -   Learned about topic: handling of "$@" in shell is intuitive
        (just works)
    -   Learned from comments: Not sure
    -   Learned about MCQs: That last option is hard to come up with.
        1-2 distractors are easy. Writing a distractor that tests
        exactly one misconception is extra hard. 2 or more is much
        simpler.
-   Violet Zhang (UPenn)
    -   I leant more about the correct usage of the the square brackets
    -   I learnt that it is very hard to cover all the misconceptions at
        once, it is tricky to design in all possible mistakes
-   Kathy Chung (U of Toronto)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/kathy-chung-mcq/>
    -   learned the "structural" similarities and differences between
        different shell commands and functions; also how hard it is to
        write good diagnostic distractors. You need to really know your
        subject and think about how others might perceive it
    -   alas, no comments
    -   learned some ?erroneous? assumptions (about the subject and
        about the learning?) people made in composing their answers &
        distractors; also how "easy" it is to select the right question
        through elimination rather than actually understanding concepts
        being tested. The elimination process was based on knowledge
        but not the knowledge being tested. Also degree of complexity
        suitable or less suitable for a MCQ?
-   Darya Vanichkina (U of Queensland Australia)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/darya-vanichkina-mcq/>
    -   Whether people see learning concepts or only by doing as the
        optimal strategy for learning SWC material
    -   Have never thought so much about two questions
-   Dorota Jarecka (U of Warsaw / NCAR)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/dorota-jarecka-mcq/>
    -   I've learned about possible misconceptions people might have and
        how easy is to not see them
    -   I'm still not sure, how easy/hard they should be (mine look a
        bit too easy)
-   Horacio Vargas (Max Planck Institut)
-   Evgenij Belikov
    -   Compiler/interpreter error messages are still relatively poor.
    -   Too many options may be misleading or question could lose
        focus.(Not sure about value of allowing multiple correct
        answers. What is best number of options?)
    -   I learned to focus on meaningful distractors and not choose
        random wrong answers. Feedback may help discover additional
        distractors.
-   Simon Fraser (Sanger Institute) Apologies for absence, will be at
    the next lesson.
-   Hugues Fontenelle (Oslo University Hospital, Norway)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/hugues-fontenelle-mcq/>
    -   I picked up a topic clear to me.. so clear it was difficult to
        create a good MCQ
    -   n/a
    -   Actually very hard to write a good one. What are the
        misconceptions? I couldn't think of any at first, but actual
        teaching in the classroom helped me identify some.

    only)
-   Belinda Weaver The University of Queensland/QCIF
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/belinda-weaver-mcq/>
    -   I learned that there is more than one right answer so you have
        to be careful how you phrase things or you can get unexpected
        results. Also it is hard to think about what misconceptions
        others might have when it seems so clear to you.
    -   That I hadn't thought it through enough - the comments were very
        helpful in highlighting that - I was focusing too much on
        formulating a question that could have four plausible answers
        instead of wondering whether the question was any good and would
        assess knowledge meaningfully!
    -   That you have to be really clear on the question as any
        ambiguity will prevent people from answering correctly. And
        simple and short questions work better than superlong
        complicated ones - I found some MCQs too intimidating because
        they were so long
-   April Clyburne-Sherin (SickKids)
    -   I learned that you need to prioritize what information you want
        before designing the questions, because your questions will
        determine what information you have to build upon.
    -   Feedback (from others, not comments) helped me realize I could
        have received better information with different questions.
    -   Looking at other people's questions was really useful in showing
        the variety of approaches and types of information you could
        retrieve through MCQs. This will really helpful for the next
        time I need to create a test.
-   Victor Kwangchun Lee (xwMOOC, Korea)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/03/victor-lee-mcq/>
    -   I learned the real value of MCQs
    -   Besides, carefully designing MCQs is also helpful to
        instructors. In particular, various MOOC courses from Udacity,
        edX and Coursera seems to have not enough distractors...
    -   From comments, I found one mistake, I assumed learners already
        know terminology and jargons.
-   Ben Weinstein (Stony Brook University) - mine needed to be repulled
    its here:
    <https://github.com/bw4sz/training-course/blob/gh-pages/_submissions/round-12/2/2015-03-10-Ben-Weinstein.md>
    -   my apologies, my .md had a bunch of html code that greg
        (sensibly) rejected.
    -   still need to figure out how to just push .md that still keeps
        the figures, without having html index.If anyone is willing to
        let me know how they do this with R + knitr, let me know. (Ben,
        you can't do that in Rmd. You need to push the figure folder as
        well.)
        -   Yeah, that was what greg rejected, i'll figure a different
            approach.Thanks! Np :)
    -   Important to clarify the difference between a misconception and
        a mistake.
    -   Trying to empathize with students and 'get into their shoes'.
        Ask, what would i select here?


**Notes:**

-   Ways to administer MCQs
    -   Hold up fingers
    -   Use four coloured sticky notes.
    -   Can use combinations.
    -   Important that everyone vote at once.
-   Other Q&A stuff: (If not enough plausible wrong answers for an MCQ)
    -   Can also flip, as them to supply why an answer is wrong.
    -   (I'm not quite sold on this one. I feel like if you ask the room
        "why is this wrong?" then strong students will answer with
        confidence while struggling ones will just feel extra "behind")

    -   Wanted: A book (or body of knowledge) like these two works for Computer Programming
        -   All it will take is 10-20 years. (A generation of experience)
-   Can start to pool our efforts, by working on what other people have
    done.
-   Single biggest factor in learning: intrinsic motivation
    -   If they have a genuine desire to understand the topic, they will
        learn it
    -   If only have extrinsic motivation (forced to do it by some external
        process/stimulus) then learning doesn't happen or is shallow)
-   In SWC almost all attendees are there because they have chosen to be
    there - so vast majority intrinsically motivated. So SWC job is to
    avoid *demotivating* them
-   The major causes of demotivitation:
    -   indifference - instructor doesn't care that students are learning
        -   Since most of us are volunteers, we usually do care
    -   unfairness - students left behind
        -   This is very possible, given that people come in with different
            levels of skill in what is being covered.
        -   Set-up issues are also very likely to happen, which will
            demoralise people before they start.
-   If an instructor is pacing the class with the fastest/ most
    "interesting" students then this makes students who are at an earlier
    stage feel unwelcome or left behind.
-   How do you avoid alienating the people who are beginners while not
    boring people who know a little?
    -   This is almost unavoidable. On a good day, we will have 1/3 bored
        and 1/3 lost.
    -   Can try and turn advanced people into ad hoc helpers.
    -   Pair people up, preferably with advanced/beginner to help them.
-   Beware demotivating intimidators:
    -   dismissive words like "just" or "trivial"
    -   too much jargon
    -   using big array of tools
    -   Saying that a concept 'is' easy - "this is easy, you should have no
        problem with this"
    -   Saying that someone isn't a computer person, or not a math person
-   If students see others being left behind they also become demotivated -
    so impacts on more than just the student directly affected
-   Four half-day sessions are better then 2 whole days and better then
    semester class for non-credit class.
-   Catching ambiguous language is one of the big benefits of working
    together on writing lessons
-   Show them that your questions are there to guide your teaching, not to
    evaluate them - disarm defensiveness
-   We re-use code, re-use science, so we should certainly re-use lesson
    plans and bits of lessons.
-   generating those MCQ is not really economical (they need a lot of
    time) - sharing them will help to save time
-   Not enough plausible distractors? Can switch to other types of
    questions, or ask them to explain why an answer is wrong
    Be aware of the topics/knowledge you test in parallel and that you might
    not be thinking of. (For example, may test addition and such in
    addition to assignment.)
