I had a demotivating experience in my first computer science course I
took in undergrad (Intro to Programming with Java).  There were quite
a few students who had previous programming experience and the
professor began to start catering to them.  A quarter of the way
through the semester the course changed from a introductory level
course to an intermediate/advanced level course.  There was a group of
students, including myself, who had never programmed before so we
began asking the TAs and the professor for assistance.  However, we
were practically ignored and told we were not studying hard enough and
that we needed to fill in the gaps ourselves.  Unfortunately, many of
the inexperienced students dropped the course and declared another
major, including myself.

This was a required course for the major so everyone had to take it no
matter his or her background.  I believe there should have been a
placement test so that students could test out of this course if they
had enough prior experience.  This would have been great for all
parties involved.  Or if this was not an option, the professors and
the TAs should have been more open to students who needed extra
assistance.
