I don't remember feeling demotivated in college, not because there were no
demotivating situations, but the situations were not serious enough
for me to remember then today.  However, I do remember one from high school.

Most of the time my performance in math exceeded that of my colleagues,
until the day, during last high school year, that I got a job.  Since then my
grades starting dropping, including in beloved math.  I was OK with that fact,
I guess it was because it felt good to be working.  I got demotivated when
I got the result from the final math exam.  The teacher said that, even
tough I passed, my grades were like a "Curva do Pregui√ßoso" (translates to
"lazy guy's curve").  That implies I got good grades at first and, when I
achieved a passing mark, I stopped studding.

Thinking back I believe that the comment demotivated me because I respected
that professor a lot.  I hoped he would have chosen to talk in private before
calling me lazy in front of the class.  Also, I think that it hurt my ego to
realized I was not "invincible."  If I juggled work and study one or the other
would suffer a low performance.

At the time I took the only action I think I could take, even today.  I waited
to talk with the professor in private and explained the situation.  He did not
care about the job, what he called an "excuse."  He said he did that for my own
good and that I should learn to take criticism "like a man."  So I ended
felling up worse than before.
