Going to university was a very demotivational experience in my education. 

I studied Maths, Physics and Chemistry at A-level (17-18 years old, for non-UK
people), and did well. However, there was a large disconnect between what
A-level covered and what the university course was expecting me to know.

For example, having done basic electronics and circuits, my first lecture on
arriving at university started with a circuit diagram that took up the entire
blackboard, and we were expected to know what it did as a basis to
understanding the rest of that track. My tutor was unavailable for meetings,
there were no mentors and no other forms of assistance. In fact, I first met my
tutor at the end of my first year, and only twice more before I graduated. The
department did not care about how well its undergraduates were doing.

Having a tutor or mentor available for orientation would have helped a great
deal, even just to provide a basic anchor or work plan in the new material so
that I could spend a few weeks or months getting up to the place the course
required.  Some preparatory work could also have been indicated so that I could
have started earlier.
