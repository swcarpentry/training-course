In college, I had a small state scholarship that paid part of my
tuition, but each year there was a different set of bureaucratic
hassles in order to get the money transferred from the state to the state
university.

After the first midterm exam in my college physics class, the pile of
graded exams didn't include mine. I asked the professor about it, and
he said, "You haven't paid your tuition. I'm not going to give you
your exam until you've settled with the university."

He was snarky about it, and he was completely unwilling to listen to
any explanation.  And it was relatively public: there was a group of
other students right next to us, fishing for their exams. I was
thoroughly embarrassed.

Up to that point, I was enjoying the class, and I thought he was a
really good teacher. But I couldn't enjoy any of the lectures
following that one 30 second experience.

#### What could have been done afteward to fix it?

I ultimately got my tuition paid and got my exam back, but I don't
remember how that went down.

I think that one bit of toxic behavior is close to unfixable. But I
suppose he could have met with me privately and shown some recognition
of the seriousness of his ill behavior, with a promise of a change in
his interactions with future students.

Looking back, I totally don't understand the situation or his
behavior.  If the university gave me a list of students who'd not yet
paid their tuition, I'd put it in the shredder and then complain to
the administration. I'm sure a lot of students are having difficulty
paying; faculty members shouldn't be in an adversarial role in
that. The university shouldn't either.
