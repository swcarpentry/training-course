I took a course in undergrad where the teacher demanded a very high
amount of work and participation from everyone in the 60 person class,
and while I was up for the challenge I struggled in the class the
entire semester because of the balent favoritism. There was a small
group of students who met with her weekly outside of class to study
(this was not made avilable ot all students, just these few) and they
received special attention in class as well, often being called on
before other students (which greatly impacted our grade since we had
to partipicate atleast once a week or we went down a letter grade). A
few of us discussed this with the professor, to no avail, and I lost
all interest in the class about half way through since I realized she
didn't really care about any of us except these few students.

To fix this situation the goal of the teacher has to be to teach all
the students, to give them all a chance to learn and participate,
always calling on the same three people does not promote an
environment whre everyone feels valued and heard. It makes it
difficult to justify asking questions or actively participating in the
course.
