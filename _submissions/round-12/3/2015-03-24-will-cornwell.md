When I was an undergrad, we had a PhD student running one of our
sections of a large course.  The course had a number of essay
assignments which were marked by the section teacher.  After working
really hard on the first essay, I got a bad mark with kind of cryptic
comments on the paper.  For the second one, I did a sloppy last minute
job and got a good mark.  For the rest of the term marks varied
randomly with respect to the quality of the work, so there was no
sense that the teacher was in any consistent or repeatable way
distinguishing good work from bad work.  This very effectively
demotivated the whole class.

I think rubrics are really great systematic tool to avoid this type of
thing.  It gives a standard assessment tool to both the marker and the
students, so the goals and the methods of measuring progress are
clear.
