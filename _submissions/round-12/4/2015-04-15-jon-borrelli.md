My practice lesson was from the novice R lessons, the _Manipulating Data_ section of [Analyzing Patient Data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html). 

I am sorry I went over time, but you can take the first 3 minutes of it and it works as a practice lesson (because I start a new topic at the 3 min mark).
