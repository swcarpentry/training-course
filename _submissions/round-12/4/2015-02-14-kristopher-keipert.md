Here is my [video](https://youtu.be/MntP8g9thrk) which discusses creating and using functions in Python. The content is derived from the [Creating Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func.html) Python lesson.

My partner commented most positively about explaining integer, float, and debugging by showcasing the error of using (5/9) instead of (5.0/9.0) as a conversion factor. Unfortunately, this discussion is left out of the 3 minute truncated video. We ran into some technical issues on my end and the audio quality is quite poor, but this is surely good practice for the real SWC teaching sessions!
