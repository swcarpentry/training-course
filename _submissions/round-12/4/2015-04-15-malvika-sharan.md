+Please check my [video](http://youtu.be/fW9lJRj-BW0). Here I demonstrate how to write a function in python. The lesson is designed for [Creating Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func.html)
+
+While practicing it with John Constable (Partner from the practice group) the recording failed miserably, but John allowed to to re-record it and gave me feedbacks.
+
+I will appreciate your feedback.
