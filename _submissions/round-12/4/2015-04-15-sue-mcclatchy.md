I taught the second half of 
[Tracking Changes](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-changes.html), a novice
lesson in the git add-commit cycle. I chose this lesson specifically because it helped
me to understand what git was doing when I issued these commands. The graphics showing
working files, the staging area, and the repository were particularly helpful. A picture
is worth a thousand words!
One of my colleagues found the lesson and the graphics very helpful as well, even though
he has a better command of git than I do. It's not intuitive.

[The video is posted on YouTube](https://youtu.be/f-Bf9hrxg34).

The first time I recorded I didn't realize you had to select an audio input
source from the drop-down menu, so there was no audio. The second time I had
technical issues with my computer. The third time worked like a charm. Practice makes
perfect.
