I recorded myself using Exception errors and showing the benefits of using assertions instead.
This 3 minute video is based on the Defensive programming part of Software Carpentry Python lessons. Therefore, I have assumed that students know already everything what is covered before in these materials.

As you will notice, I’m not used to explain these kind of exercises in English since I am Spanish ^^
Perhaps I should have reduced the content due to my lack of fluency, but preparing and recording this example help me a lot to really understand these defensive programming techniques.

I used screencast-o-matic.com and the IPython notebook with Anaconda and Python 3.
It took me around 60 minutes to record and publish the video here.

Comments are more than welcome :-)
