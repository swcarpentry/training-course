My [video](https://youtu.be/N8S_4uEUwyE) was about
[Repeating Actions with Loops](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/02-loop.html)

The recording has some background noise because I was in a public space at the
time.  Besides that the video is OK to watch.  The teaching though...  I feel
that there is plenty of room for improvement.  Specially if I remove the first
part "looping over a string" and go straight to, a more useful skill,
opening multiple files.

Special thanks to Matthews Collins for recording the video.
