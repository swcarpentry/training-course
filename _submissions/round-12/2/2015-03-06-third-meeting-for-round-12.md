---
We had another good round of meetings this week.
Most people said they found the concept mapping exercise useful,
but a significant minority did say that it didn't fit the way they think,
or that they thought it was more effort than it was worth.

About a dozen people also said that they're still trying to figure out Git, GitHub, Markdown,
and how those three things fit together.
If you'd like some help in the next two weeks,
please mail Greg and he'll pair you up with someone.
Please don't be shy about asking:
this is our first time using a GitHub-based blog,
and every question you ask helps us figure out how to do better next time.

Our focus for the next two weeks is developing quick multiple choice questions (MCQs)
that we can use for formative assessment,
i.e.,
to get feedback as we're teaching
about how much people are actually learning.
To do this:

1.  Pick a small topic *from our existing lessons*.
    It doesn't have to be different from the topic you used for your concept map,
    but choosing something new will give you an opportunity to learn more about our lessons.
2.  Come up with two MCQs and add them to the blog in the `_submissions/round-12/2` directory.
    Please use `yyyy-mm-dd-forename-surname.md` as the filename
    (e.g., `2015-03-06-greg-wilson.md`)
    and `/yyyy/mm/forename-surname-mcq/` as the permalink
    (e.g., `/2015/03/greg-wilson-mcq/`).
    1.  Start your blog post with a sentence about the lesson your MCQ is for,
        and a link to the lesson.
    2.  The first MCQ should present the question and possible answers
        without any analysis or explanation.
    3.  The second MCQ should present the question and possible answers
        and then explain what misconception each of distractors
        (i.e., the deliberately wrong answers)
        is meant to diagnose.
    Note that you should have misconceptions in mind when choosing distractors for the first question;
    you just shouldn't add them to the post.
    These posts are due by next Thursday (March 12, 2015).

3.  Once posts are up,
    give at least three people feedback on their MCQs.
    1.  Try to distribute your feedback:
        if a post already has a couple of comments,
        look for one that doesn't have any.
    2.  Try to answer the first MCQ (the one that the author hasn't analyzed),
        and also try in your comment to explain what misconception *you* think
        the distractors are meant to diagnose.
    3.  For both MCQs,
        give feedback on whether it's ambiguous,
        whether the distractors are plausible,
        how long you think it would take to answer,
        and anything else that comes to mind.
    Feedback is due before our next meeting,
    which will be on Thursday, March 19.

**Reading:** Please read Chapter 3 of *How Learning Works*,
since our next exercise will be about motivation and demotivation.

**10:00 Eastern**

-   Michael Sarahan, Nion Co.
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/manipulating-data-with-r/>
    -   Maybe just a link to the Jekyll docs would be sufficient for me
    -   About 1 hour
    -   I liked being forced to examine the connections, and for my
        topic in particular, how topics are interconnected. If I taught
        the topic, I would reinforce looking at the output of selection
        and of functions, to show the interconnection/type.
    -   I learned a lot of organizational schemes and graphical
        elements. There's also an interesting mix of concept vs.
        procedure.
-   Daiva Nielsen, University of Toronto
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/loops-in-the-shell/>
    -   The headers that were needed (I figured that out by looking at
        other people's .md files)
    -   \~2.5 hours. I'm a slow reader, took a while to read the lesson,
        digest it & understand it, then to figure out how to map it.
    -   Now I understand why loops are structured the way that they are
        and why they are useful.
    -   It's just interesting to see how others organize information
        visually. I noticed lots of different visualizations and two
        people asked to draw a concept map about the same topic would
        probably draw maps that look quite different.
-   Karl Broman, U Wisconsin-Madison,
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/gnu-make/>
    -   The github blog post stuff was pretty clear for me.
    -   I spent about an hour on it; would've taken longer if I hadn't
        cheated by (a) covering something not in swc v5 and (b) not
        labeling the edges
    -   I'm not sure I learned anything new, but I didn't really stretch
        myself on this.
    -   Small ones with labeled edges are quite informative. I generally
        t8hink in terms of a hierarchy or outline, but I appreciate the
        value in not having to specify a particular order of topics in
        the network diagram
-   Simon Fraser, Sanger Institute
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/pipes-and-redirection/>
-   Konrad Förstner, Universtiy of Würzburg, Germany,
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/concept-map-shell-scripts/>
    -   Where a good template/example could be found
    -   30 min
    -   Not much - I think I should have take something more
        challenging/new to me
    -   It's hard to boil a topic down to a small selection of key
        concepts. But once done they give a good overview
-   Hugues Fontenelle (Oslo University Hospital) -
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-add-commit/>
    -   Greg's blog post was good. Just I wish I had found it before I
        posted my own.
    -   Doing the concept map during an actual SWC seminar.. a few
        seconds! (But over an hour uploading the pic and writing the
        image wrapper)
    -   Keep it simple is often better
    -   A concept map does not need to be an algorithm/flowchart
-   Sarah Mount (University of Wolverhampton) -
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-merge-conflicts/>
    -   (blog posts on GitHub) A bit more about the directory structure
        would have been great
    -   20 mins
    -   It's really, really hard to describe some ideas without examples
    -   That concept maps have a stricter syntax than I thought
-   Filipe Fernandes:
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/pyfunc-concept-map/>
    -   I am used to jekyll, so I am of no help here.
    -   2-3 hours. But I re-visited it the next day before submitting.
    -   I am not sure yet how to use concept maps to teaching, but I
        like the idea of having them around for students to see while I
        explain a something.
    -   I learned that concepts maps about the same topic might convey
        completely different messages.
-   Laura Graham (University of Nottingham):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-modify-add-commit-cycle/>
    -   Nothing really, I quite like learning from example (and looking
        at other .md files was good for this). I would however now like
        to know where to look for more information so that I could
        potentially set up my own blog this way.
    -   About 30-45 minutes, but I probably should have spent a little
        longer because (as the comments let me know), I got \`git add\`
        a little bit wrong.
    -   It made me think more about how everything is connected, I now
        have a better idea of the steps involved in making changes to a
        git repository and find I can complete the git modify-add-commit
        cycle without really thinking about it.
    -   The easier to understand concept maps were those with enough,
        but not too much, information.
-   Arliss Collins (Mozilla Science Lab) -
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/open-science-licensing/>
    -   can't think of anything that would have sped it up
    -   about 2 hours - probably because of my perfectionist side and I
        included the reading of the lesson
    -   concept maps for the same topic can look very different
-   Joseph Long, Space Telescope Science Institute -
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/python-functions-concept-map/>
    -   I didn't have much trouble with the blog posts and pull
        requests. For the future, an example post might have been
        helpful (e.g. to suggest including one's name in the permalink).
        My only problem was that someone else chose the same permalink
        as me after comments had already been made on mine...
    -   The concept map took about 25 min (and three drafts)never
    -   How hard it is to distill a complex relationship into boxes and
        arrows! "Result" as a concept was used on edges, but could have
        also been a box itself... but that could have made those edges
        harder to read.
    -   From the other concept maps and comments I got some different
        perspectives on the most important information to incorporate.
        (Everyone agreed on the core concepts, but the details varied
        from person to person.)
-   Adam Richie-Halford (University of Washington):
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/databases-selecting-with-sql/>
    -   I was pretty happy with publishing the blog posts
    -   How long: approx. 1 hour (not including the reading)
    -   What did I learn about the topic: I was completely new to SQL so
        I learned a lot.
    -   What did I learn about concept mapping: It's easier to get
        started if you think about the topic hierarchically (i.e. draw a
        concept map that looks like an org chart or a binary tree). But
        then it can be difficult to connect the leaves of different
        branches. This reminds me a bit of how "novices" organize their
        knowledge: to go from one leaf to another, they may have to
        travel up the entire "tree" to go back down to another leaf.
-   Daniel Wheeler (National Institute of Standards and Technology):
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/pipes-and-filters-wheeler/>
    -   Distinct naming for permalinks
    -   How long: about 1 hour
    -   Thought about the connection between concept maps and flow
        diagrams and how they interact.
    -   The concept map focused my thoughts on the important
        abstractions in unix pipes and how to convey those abstractions,
        but how useful are abstractions to a beginner.
-   Kyler Brown (U of Chicago)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/range-concept-map/>
    -   What is the function of the header?
    -   45 minutes
    -   I probably made my concept map too busy
    -   connecting arrows can be "verbs"
-   Matt Probert (York UK)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/mpi-point-to-point-communications/>
    -   Did the minimal, seemed to work ok, the on-line help is good
    -   Thought about it lots during the week, then took about 1 hour
        from start to finish
    -   Basic ideas ok
    -   Keep it simple - I did not appreciate it was meant to be
        something that could be taught in 10 minutes - I was thinking
        about the concept map for the topic instead.
-   Ben Weinstein
    <https://github.com/swcarpentry/training-course/blob/gh-pages/_submissions/round-12/1/2015-02-22-plotting-function-R.md>
    -   (no answers posted)
-   Victor (Kwangchun) Lee (xwMOOC, Korea)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-backup/>
    -   The github blog approach is fine for me. and with other small
        pieces, perm link and image link. The github blog can do more
        things with limited resources much faster.
    -   It took around 5 min.
    -   I could understand what I know in a different aspect. and look
        back from workshop attendees.
    -   Someday, concept map comparison with English and Korean
-   Johan Hjelm (Technical University of Denmark)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/python-lists/>
    -   maybe some more info on the headers
    -   2 - 2.5 hours, took a while to decide on a topic as well
    -   I think I got thinking a bit about how much to include when
        teaching beginners, I tend to add too much material...
    -   it was interesting to see how different people view the same
        topic,
-   Marios Isaakidis (Mozilla Reps)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/defensive-programming-concept-map-misaakidis/>
    -   How to use jekyll to serve training-course locally
    -   Around 1h15m
    -   Key entities/elements in concept maps are better inter-connected
        and are placed in the middle of the map
    -   Concept maps can be extended to use symbols, lists etc. to help
        match how someone clusters elements
-   Violet Zhang (University of Pennsylvania)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/collaborating-using-git/>
    -   I saw your email for the Github blog post before I made any
        comment
    -   it took me about 30 min to make the concept map
    -   Not much, but I feel like I know the connections between key
        concepts better
    -   I know that I am very bad at drawing concept maps, too much
        wordings in the map
-   Remi Daigle (University of Toronto)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/loading-data-in-R/>
    -   I was pretty confused about the headers
    -   \~45 min
    -   That read.csv is really just a sub-function of read.table
    -   That you really want an action word on all the links (labeled
        edges)
-   Jessica Gallinger (University of Saskatchewan)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/data-hygiene-concept-map/>
    -   I did not understand how GitHub functioned whatsoever
    -   \~30 minutes
    -   What to include in the subject area (using the lesson plan)
    -   The variety of ways people represent their ideas
-   Javier Garcia-Algarra (UPM, Madrid, Spain)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/dataframe-conceptmap/>
    -   about 60 minutes
    -   I am not very good explaining sw concepts with graphs
-   Donna Henderson (University of Oxford)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/relative-and-absolute-paths/>
    -   info about the format to add images and links
    -   about 30 minutes
    -   not sure, I'll come back to this
    -   how different people associate command to the concepts in
        different ways, ie if a command is a node or an edge
-   John Constable (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/submissions/round-12/1/2015-02-24-files-and-directories.html>
    -   I would have liked the overview available to start with to help
        me make sense of the 'why', plus it wasn't clear about the
        jenkins integration was needed for offline viewing, not
        'published' website
    -   about 2 hours including reading the referenced paper to get the
        details of concept map and a couple of abortive attempts
    -   I (re)learned about how inodes work!
    -   I learned how hard it is to reduce concept to 7+/- concepts, and
        how the relationship link is so hard to define simply
-   Burke Squires (NIAID)
    <https://github.com/swcarpentry/training-course/blob/gh-pages/_submissions/round-12/1/2015-02-26-concept-map-functions-in-python.md>
    -   Nothing
    -   2 - 3 hours; wish I could have used OmniGraffle!
    -   What (if anything) you learned about your topic from doing your
        concept map (i.e., what do you now understand more clearly about
        your subject)
    -   How differently people see the same concepts and communicate
        them - functions in python
-   Narayanan Raghupathy (The Jackson Lab)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/python-conditionals-concept-map/>
    -   nothing
    -   about an hour to choose a topic & get the hang of concept map
        and an hour to get the map
    -   the connections among different things in my topic and how I can
        not cram all the things I want to teach in just 10 mins.
    -   looking at other people's concept maps helped me to learn how I
        could have done better and also it made clear regarding git
        concepts
-   Arvind Sundaram (Norwegian Sequencing Centre)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-github-collaboration/>
    -   Information about blogs have been clear till now
    -   4-5 hours to think (while doing other things) about the topic
        and 30 mins to draw
    -   concept is much clearer to me than before
    -   confirms that everyone has their own perspective of the same
        concept
-   Heather Gibling
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/heather-gibling/>
    -   linking to images -- is HTML the only way? Or can the
        'markdown' way be used?
    -   \~1 hour thinking/drawing + \~1 hour revising
    -   branches can be broken down into 3 basic types
    -   less text is more visually appealing and easier to understand
        (less intimidating)
-   Pawel Pomorski (University of Waterloo)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/test-driven-development/>
    -   2 hours thinking, 20 minutes drawing (had to redo the drawing as
        first one ended up too much like a flowchart)
    -   doing concept map for the first time showed me how this can be
        useful in figuring out the order in which interconnected
        concepts should be taught
    -   would be more useful for material that is completely unknown to
        me
    -   hard to decide how much text to include in the concept map
        (speed of drawing vs. understanding by others)
-   Owen Stephens (Owen Stephens Consulting)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/dataframes-in-r/>
    -   Happy publishing blog posts
    -   1 hour to think about topic, \<30 minutes to draw. Did one draft
        and then a 'good' version
    -   Looking at comparable lessons there were some opportunities I
        missed in mine - especially triggering previous learning for the
        viewer
        
**15:00 Eastern**

-   Sarah W (college)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/what-is-git-and-setup/>
    -   where a template is located, maybe a bit about the headers, and
        the naming for the permanent links, perhaps a bit about more Git
        / github
    -   \~ an hour (I kept revising)
    -   I learned that even looking and drawing a very small part of the
        lesson was still incredibly involved.
    -   Looking at the other maps, I found it very interesting that
        sometimes people's brains were inserting steps in that I
        couldn't see or understand. Sometimes my brain couldn't make the
        link. I'm sure I did the same thing in my map.
-   Matt Dickenson
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/submissions/round-12/1/2015-02-23-functions-in-python.html>
    -   To double-check that the image actually worked
    -   About 3-4 hours
    -   To better elaborate connections between concepts (edges in the
        concept map)
    -   The importance of making conceptually central topics also
        visually central in the map
-   Matthew Bourque (Space Telescope Science Institute)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/sql-select-statement/>
    -   To be cautious about image sizes
    -   A little over an hour
    -   How to limit the level of detail so that the concept is not too
        overwhelming
    -   Maps about the same concept can differ significantly, as people
        approach the same problem in different ways
-   Catherine Devlin (18F)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/null/>
    -   I'm good with publishing blog posts, been doing it for a while
    -   Concept map took me about 1.5 hours - so much longer than I
        expected!
    -   Better understand relationship between line-by-line effects of
        3-value logic and its implications for full result sets
    -   It's really hard to keep a concept map's scope under control!
-   Belinda Weaver (The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/concept-map-for-Git/>
    -   Not much really - having done the first I could copy the header
        which I did struggle with on the first one
    -   Embarrassingly long - hours - lots of revisions and I still
        wasn't happy - I am a linear person not a picture person
    -   I did see more connections as I went on trying to visualise it
        in different ways - seeing other people's maps also helped with
        that. I also discussed my map with a colleague who helped me
        reconceptualise it
    -   That other people do concept maps much better than I can ;) - I
        learned a lot by looking at so many
-   Sarah Stevens (University of Wisconsin - Madison)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/python-if-conditional/>
    -   Maybe a little more info about how the post must be formatted
        and then stitches to the blog
    -   30 min.- 1 hr.
    -   I feel I better understand how connected the different concepts
        are to one another. They are connected as such in my mind but I
        think I would normally try to lay it out more linearly for a new
        student and forget to try and connect them back.
    -   I learned that the concept map is very reflective of the
        different ways people think. Even given some sort of structure,
        it is a bit different for each person.
-   Kim Moir (Mozilla)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/pipes-and-filters/>
    -   publishing seemed fine, had to resize the images
    -   An hour. I found it really difficult.
    -   how to break up the concepts into discrete parts
    -   other people are really good at it! Can take a look of thought
        and detail. I prefer the simpler ones. The ones with too much
        detail can be overwhelming.
-   Sue McClatchy (The Jackson Laboratory)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/creating-functions-in-R/>
    -   A simple link to the blog would have been very helpful. I tried
        to figure out how to do it using the command line, then after
        receiving Greg's follow-up e-mail realized that it was nothing
        more than adding comments to a blog.
    -   It took me about 2 hours to read the lesson, consider the
        concepts involved, arrange them into an initial draft concept
        map, then upgrade to a final map.
    -   I understood how the pieces of this concept fit together. I'd
        never considered how curly brackets relate to a function call,
        for example.
    -   I learned that we all organize our thinking differently. I knew
        this already but had never seen it graphically.

    (pull request is still pending)
    -   maybe not necessary: but more details on how it all fits
        together
    -   20-30 min; I've done mindmaps before
    -   I hadn't thought to use them as a learning assessment tool
    -   I might like mindmaps better (more emphasis on
        color/drawing/connections), but perhaps less useful as a
        learning tool

    -   Do not hurry in committing the changes and work through the
        terminal rather than the github pages directly.
    -   more than 5 trials and several pages for a simple concept map
        which i did not expect as i considered myself good at drawing :)
    -   Drawing a concept map is hard in the beginning but its a *good
        way to put all the features/idea related to a topic on a page
        and re-visit the ideas that i rarely use.*
    -   To draw my concept map i looked/refereed at others map, some of
        the concept maps were very complicated to understand compared to
        the concept itself, but some of them were neat and easy to
        understand: *I learnt not to use too many boxes for the concept
        map, it can overwhelm people, its better to break the concept in
        smaller concepts and explain them individually.*

    -   I wish I had known about including the header information
    -   About 30 minutes but 2 attempts
    -   I found out I need to think more about connections between
        concepts and that the way I have been thinking about it may make
        it more difficult to understand if you had never thought about
        conditionals before.
    -   From what I looked at it seems very important to think more
        about how specific concepts are connected, often we tend to
        clump concepts together when they should be separate boxes that
        are connected.

    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-remote/>
    -   The blog posting seemed pretty straightforward. I just used the
        template, and found out that github pages used jekyll, so I
        looked that up anyway. No real trouble.
    -   I took about 30 minutes to get something workable, and then had
        fairly minimal suggestions for revision, so was able to make
        those changes in about 15 minutes or so.
    -   The idea was relatively solid in my head, but it did help me to
        make some things more concrete.
    -   That it is quite blurry to draw a line between "concept map" and
        "flow chart", if you are making a concept map about a process.
-   Peter Fields (University of Basel)
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/unix-shell-files-directories/>
    -   The blog posting was relatively straightforward. Probably the
        aspect I was least familiar with was the use of a fork. The
        literature available through github made execution of the
        updating of the fork easy though.
    -   In total time for the creation of the concept map was about 2
        hours. This included looking at example plots, and then
        determining which of the lessons I felt most comfortable with. I
        had initially thought of doing more complicated lessons but then
        I felt less comfortable with how well I might actually
        understand the more advanced lessons.
    -   I'm not sure I learned a great deal more about the concept,
        perhaps as the result my answer to question two. It did make
        think a bit more about how a person newer to Unix might try to
        understand the concept, perhaps linking it to things they knew
        more about.
    -   I learned a lot about a number of different concepts, and
        reinforced others I knew something already about. But there
        certainly were clear instances of emphasis on things that I may
        not have made.

    -   What I wish Greg had told you about publishing blog posts on
        GitHub
        -   What is markup and how does it work? I don't actually know
            why what I did worked. I just sort of blindly copied what I
            saw in other files.
    -   How long it took you to do your concept map (thinking +
        drawing + revising)
        -   Maybe 30 minutes?
    -   What (if anything) you learned about your topic or how to teach
        it from doing your concept map (i.e., what do you now understand
        more clearly about your subject)
        -   It can be quite hard to make meaningful connections to past
            knowledge
        -   Starting from the basics might be too basic for some
            learners (or not?)
    -   What you learned about drawing concept maps from the ones you
        looked at
        -   There are a lot of different ways to draw a concept map! I
            always thought of concept maps as using circles. It's a
            weird thing to assume and makes me question what else I'm
            assuming about the right way to do things.
        -   I also felt like I had too little content for a good concept
            map?
        -   Concept maps without edge labels were much harder to
            interpret
        -   It can be quite easy to include a term without defining it
            because the author overestimates their expertise.
-   Andrew MacDonald (University of British Columbia)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/what-is-a-commit/>
    -   1\) that you're supposed to have a header and 2) do be careful not to use
        the same URL as somebody else, or you will clobber their post (sorry
        Michael)
    -   My concept map took about 1hr - 30 mins to choose something, 10
        to draw it an 20min trying to find a way to get it into a
        computer. \<This sounds familiar. mtb
    -   I think I improved my thinking about my topic (which was "What
        is a commit"). I feel like many of the other concept maps that
        I saw were covering something too large. I'm also confused about
        how as SWC instructors we are going to use concept maps: are we
        supposed to draw them in front of a room of students? Do we use
        them to organize our thinking before we create a SWC lesson?

        missed
    -   \~1hr
    -   Forced me to think about how I would lay out how I would teach
        it
    -   That people have different ideas of how to set up a concept map,
        tho I really do think a well-developed concept map can speak a
        thousand words
-   Kristopher Keipert (IAState)

    -   Permalink rules
    -   \~45 minutes (20min thinking, 10min drawing, 15min
        revising)
    -   I reinforced links between information that were already there.
        Being self-aware of the linkages between concepts will likely
        help me convey the information to others.
    -   It is difficult for me to distinguish between a concept map and
        a flow chart
-   Amy Boyle (Washington State University)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/pipes-are-rad/>
    -   \~1.5 hour
    -   Got me to think about how all the pieces connect more, and how I
        would explain that to others
    -   I'm actually pretty comfortable on Github, I use gh-pages for my
        personal blog
    -   It was interesting to see how people organize information in
        their brain differently than me for the same subject

    -   I co-run a similar jekyll-based "blog" at
        <http://gallery.rcpp.org> so was familiar before
    -   Maybe 30 to 45 mins.
    -   Not much, but I cheated and took an easy topic
    -   I am not yet sold on concept maps, but I do like visual
        sketches.
-   Auriel Fournier
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/git-conflict/>
    -   probably 45 minutes or so
    -   It helped me visualize it better, and explain it better to
        others
    -   How the headers worked,
    -   I probably don't have the level of mastery I need to really
        match together the big ideas and concepts. I'm still going the
        long way through things.

    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/python-errors-exceptions-concept-map/>
    -   a few hours
    -   I had a better idea of the different types of Exceptions
    -   After I got the hang of it, posting on GitHub wasn't that bad.
    -   It helps to have the both the concepts and connections labeled
-   Evgenij Belikov (Heriot-Watt University)
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/function-concept-map/>
    -   some more info on markdown/Jekyll
    -   ca. 1h
    -   justifying the use of functions is easier based on making
        relations to other concepts (e.g. code quality) and teaching
        from general to specific following the hierarchy of the concept
        map
    -   few concepts usually chosen by most people but few different
        concepts and relations came up in different maps

    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/tracking-changes-to-files/>
    -   It took me about 2 hours to do my concept map.
    -   It really helped solidify how staging and tracking files works! I
        also think it helped me learn how to explain tracking files in git.
    -   I wish I had known about the '!' infront of the link when posting to
        the blog, but had a comment help me out, which was nice.
    -   I learned that it is really difficult to create a concept map rather
        than a flow-chart, or hierarchy chart. Teasing out the concepts
        requires a more in-depth understanding of the lesson than I
        originally thought.

    -   concept map took about 2-3+ hrs?
    -   what I learnt re. topic (git repos & commands): thinking about
        relationships btw the repos, I realise I'm fuzzy about how
        collaborators resolve conflicts when both have modified a file;
    -   re. submitting blog posts:(1) how to submit comments (looks like
        you have to create a ?discus? [can't remember name] account
        before your comments show up; (2) I had trouble using the search
        function on the blog page [tried with three different browsers:
        chrome, firefox, IE]. I wanted to find posts by Greg and found
        it hard to do so (3) keep the images small
    -   Re concept maps: it's hard to identity or decide which are the
        concepts, what makes a concept, and how to label relationships.
        For example, I found, looking at other people's concept maps,
        that what some people consider concepts seem to me relationships
        or actions
-   Will Cornwell (UNSW, Australia) [pull request still needs to be
    merged]
    -   Concept map took about 30 min.
    -   Did learn something about how to present how to explain how
        different classes in R need to be dealt with in different ways
    -   I didn't totally understand whether the concept map was supposed
        to out conceptual understanding of the subject--as we would
        explain it to students--versus representing what is the in
        lesson. Also still don't understand when the headers are
        necessary
    -   Seems to be some conceptual differences about what a concept map
        is
-   Kai Yang (U of Washington) (pull request still needs to be merged)
    -   At current moment (6 pm EST) my concept map posting did have
        chance to be listed on
        <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/submissions/round-12/index.html>,
        although I received acknowledgment for my pull request a week
        ago. The gap between pull request and merge sounds a black box
        to me. Maybe Greg is able to provide a mechanism to make the
        workflow easier to trace.
    -   I spent around four hours to work and polish my concept map.
    -   The concept map helped me to clarify how to present the topic
        rather than learn the topic.
    -   Since I am studying graph databases (another hot NoSQL), I
        particularly paid attention to how people presented concept map
        with a graph. From this exercise, I realized graph data modeling
        is not as straightforward as vendors claimed.

-   Tessa Pierce (Scripps Institution of Oceanography)
    -   no requests about blog posts on github - I've been looking into
        this a fair bit in trying to make my own blog
    -   1-2 hrs
    -   Learned from my concept map: it's difficult to condense your
        knowledge into a simple but comprehensive graphical
        representation
    -   Learned from other's concept maps: shapes, layout etc can be
        helpful in distinguishing concepts from processes
-   Laurie Baker (Glasgow University)
    -   20 minutes
    -   I realize now that I made my concept map more of a flow chart.
        Seeing other people's made me see how you could use the concept
        as a guide for people work flow or to show them how different
        aspects relate.
    -   I liked how some people wrote on the connectors to explain the
        relationship and integrated different aspects of their map. For
        example using an outer larger circle to encompass things that
        went on within a certain part of git hub.

    -   \~15 min
    -   I learned that what I was thinking of as concepts were not
        concepts but rather processes and what I thought were processes
        turned out to be the concepts
    -   I wish Greg had given some more specific info about posting
        images online
    -   What I learned from other people's maps was that it's useful to
        include many kinds of information

    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/mutable-immutable-python-concept-map/>
    -   1-2 h
    -   I was surprised by the variety of concept maps I have seen. It
        seems that this idea is more likely an individual exercise. I
        guess with practise better concept maps (i.e. understandable to
        anyone, better formatting, etc) can be drawn.
    -   PR can be directly updated from source (I learnt this before,
        but it could have been a problem 2 weeks ago)
    -   I think I (finally) understood better the topic addressed
        (immutable vs mutable). This one has resisted me since I learnt
        programming with a language that didn't care about this.
-   Galen Collier (Clemson University)
    -   Not yet sure about what it would have been helpful for Greg to
        address about GitHub blog posts. I'll update this entry if I
        think of something.
    -   Time spent: just a few minutes for each part of the process. I
        selected one of the simpler topics (shell commands), so it
        should have been a relatively concise concept map. I was working
        under the impression that it would be most useful to create a
        concept map on-the-fly when it's needed to briefly explain
        something during the teaching process, so I wanted to practice
        with quick, simple concept maps.
    -   Learned from my own concept map: creating the concept map gave
        me an opportunity to revise my pattern of thought when it comes
        to teaching that concept. I haven't been using concept maps in
        teaching, and I now realize how efficient they can be.
    -   Learned from looking at others' maps: examining the concept maps
        that others helped me better understand how to make a concept
        map more useful for teaching. Seeing the specific features that
        need to be present and the general format helped me revise my
        approach to creating concept maps and seeing the variety of
        examples helped demonstrate to me that this can be used for a
        very broad range of technology concepts.

    -   What (if anything) you learned I read a bit more about what a
        cursor actually is and contains

    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/02/unix-files-directories/>

    -   How long it took you to do your concept map (thinking + drawing +
        revising)
        -   20 minutes. Did 2 drafts, since the first time around my layout
            was completely hairball
    -   What (if anything) you learned about your topic or how to teach it
        from doing your concept map
        -   Made it clearer in my mind as to how the concepts link, hence
            easier to teach
    -   What I wish Greg had told you about publishing blog posts on GitHub
        -   Nothing really, I run a personal website on github, so I've had
            to figure out how to get jekyll/md to work when setting that up
            (which was FRUSTRATING)
    -   What did you learn from drawing your concept map (i.e., what do you now understand more clearly about your
        subject)
        -   How to teach it.
    -   What I learned from others: how differently different people see
        even the same simple topic.
    
**Notes 2015-03-05**

-   Feedback about concept maps
    -   What you leave out is as important as what you put in.
        -   Scope control.
        -   You can use "blank spaces" in concept maps, indicating
            knowledge you don't plan to teach but that still relates to
            what you're teaching
    -   You need to know what knowledge is needed for what you do.
    -   Concept map can show you whether you have too much stuff that
        you will try and do.
-   Glass's Law: any new tool or technique initially slows you down
-   Two different people will draw different concept map unless they
    have worked together and developed a consensus approach
    -   Over time, their mental models of things start to align.
-   Feedback is not nearly as common in teaching as in most other things
    (music, paper-writing, presentation)
    -   Requires a culture of trust. Need to understand how to give that
        feedback.
    -   Getting novices to accept and give code review in some sort of
        formal way is relatively rare.
    -   Feedback for coding\\programming is standard practice in
        industry
-   Asking questions:
    -   Find a question that will indicate whether learning has occurred
        or not.
        -   Needs to be quick.
    -   Asking 'do you know X' does not actually provide assessment of
        knowledge or indicate depth of knowledge.
-   Pair Programming
    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming>
    -   \~ two people - one keyboard
        -   "pilot" at the keyboard
        -   navigator helping
    -   the benefits of this constellation seems to take of after some
        weeks; they
    -   also good technique to use in workshops
    -   One person typing, but both people solving the problem -
        knowledge transfer & communication
    -   Start using it early so that people won't feel like they are
        being singled out if you introduce it later on
    -   Can let them pair with whoever they are sitting beside, but in a
        more structured environment better for instructor to organize
        pairs/groups
    -   Question: Greg Wilson: suppose you are putting students in
        groups of 4 to work on an exercise, you know their standing in
        the class (i.e., their grades), how should you group them?
    -   a\) they choose
    -   b\) randomly
    -   c\) top 4, then next 4, etc.
    -   d\) striping (A, B, C, D in one group, then next A, next B, next C, next
        D in the next group, etc.) to get wide spread of ability in each group
    -   Results:
        -   Option D) give the best results for people at all levels,
            not just the ones at the bottom.
        -   Self-select is the worst option, they will just group with
            their friends
        -   Random works better than striking (Option C - top 4, next
            top 4, etc..)
        -   Affect wears off after approx 6 weeks
    -   when setting up a workshop check that pairing up is easy
    -   Every relationship between concepts could be a concept on its
        own (the words on the arrows could be boxes)
- Concept maps
    -   What you leave out of them is also important
-   Formative vs. summative assessment
    -   Good teaching requires rapid feedback so see if/where the
        teaching failed
    -   you want a formative assesment - while the teaching take place
    -   MCQ - Multiple choice question
        -   can be useful if properly designed
        -   bad: do not help to learn about be misconceptions of the
            learner; lack of diagnostic power
        -   good: one right answer and 3-4 plausible distractors
    -   Advantage - they are fast
    -   Example of good multiple choice Q: What is 27 + 15?
        -   a\) 42
        -   b\) 32
        -   c\) 312
        -   d\) 33
    -   Each wrong answer typifies a common mistake made when learning
        multi-digit addition and so provides a diagnostic tool for
        tackling issues in the class
    -   Much better than having MCQ answers where one answer is right
        and the others are incorrect but don't give any clue to what has
        been misunderstood
    -   This is a bad one:
        -   27 + 15 = ?
            -   a\) 42
            -   b\) 1001
            -   c\) -5
            -   d\) a fish!
    -   There is no way to link a wrong answer to a particular
        misconception, unlike the first one.
    -   MCQ design requires thought about likely misconceptions. (It's
        like unit testing on your class!) - thus drives better lesson
        design (like TDD) (Or designing an experiment)
    -   Use MCQ \~4 times in a class of one hour
        -   Can put question up using projector
            -   Answers can be done using
                -   fingers (1 to 4 for each answer)
                -   sticky notes
                -   letters on a card
    -   OpenUK has an example of excellent online assessment
    -   Most of the time we are at the speed of the most advance
        learners. With MCQ we have feedback if we leave learner behind
    -   casual, rough-looking forms of feedback help defuse the
        adversarial feeling that "I'm being evaluated!"
    -   morale will significantly go up and learning improves as
        learners feel that the teacher cares about their learning
    -   Peer instructions
-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction>
    -   Motivation: If group of learners understood a concept they all
        understand it the same; if they did not understand it they might
        understand different parts
    -   Video:

    -   Scales much better than broadcast-style instruction!
    -   This may slow down the amount of material you can "cover", but
        now you're matching the actual speed of learning
    -   Peer instruction:
    -   ask MCQ
    -   Have people answer/vote
    -   In groups each tries to convince the others that their answer is
        the correct one
    -   Vote again
    -   Give correct answer
    -   Have groups discuss again - members can identify where others
        are misunderstanding
        -   Misconceptions are most likely to be unique to each person.
        -   Working together with a peer is likely to highlight these.
    -   Mixing people of different abilities gives good results, because
        the top is forced to explain things to the bottom. Teaching is a
        great way to learn.
