My MCQ's are for the lesson "The Unix Shell - Files and Directories" that can be found [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-filedir.html)

## First

If Nelle wanted to count ALL the directories in her current working directory which command should she use ... ?

1.  ls -a
2.  ls
3.  ls -F -a
4.  pwd

## Second

If the output from the Unix command "pwd" shows /users/nelle/molecules ... how can you get to Nelle's home directory using an absolute path

1.  cd ..
2.  cd users/nelle
3.  cd .
4.  cd /users/nelle

## Distortions

1.  this will get you to the right place but it is a relative path
2.  this looks like an absolute path but if forgets the "/" root directory at the beginning
3.  this will not get to the right place and it is a relative path
4.  correct answer
