These questions are based off Analyzing Patient Data from [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy.html)

Given this list:

    my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Which element will be printed with the following command:

print my_list[-1]

1.  `0`
2.  `1`
3.  `9`
4.  `8`

Using this same list, what would be printed with the following command:

    print my_list[2:9]

1.  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
2.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
3.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
4.  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

The misconceptions are:

1.  Using inclusive end.
2.  Started index at 1 instead of 2.
3.  Both bad index start and using inclusive end.
4.  Correct.
