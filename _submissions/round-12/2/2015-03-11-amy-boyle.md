I made my multiple choice questions based on the material from the [first python lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy.html).

Q1. Consider the following code:

    a = 7
    b = a + 3
    a = 2

What does b equal?

    A. 5
    B. 10
    C. 73
    D. a3


Q2. If you have a numpy array, in a variable `bats`, how would you access the data item at the 5th column, 2nd row?

    A. bats[2,5]
    B. bats(1,4)
    C. bats[1,4]
    D. bats[4,1]


* C is the correct answer.
* A is the answer they would get if they were indexing from 1 instead of 0
* B is the answer if they where mixing up round brackets, which call functions,
and square brackets which access a element of an iterable.
* D is if they mix up that indexing is [row, column], not [column, row].
