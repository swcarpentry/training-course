### Diagnostic question: data types

Suppose you have the following datasets:

    x = ['leopard', 'panther', 'pallas cat']
    y = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
    z = [(1, 1), (4, 4), (9, 9), (16, 16)]

In order, what types of data are these? 

1.  List, array, list of arrays
1.  List, list, list of tuples
1.  Array, array, array of tuples
1.  Ambiguous/could be multiple types

### Summative question: indexing

Suppose you run the following code:

    n = [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]]
    print n[2]

What gets printed?

1.  [6, 5, 4]
1.  2
1.  7
1.  [3, 2, 1]

Analysis:

1.  Those who choose (a) understand the structure of the list, but forget that Python indexing starts at 0.
2.  Those who choose (b) fail to understand that n[2] is selecting for the item with index 2 and not the value 2.
3.  Those who choose (c) understand that Python indexing starts at 0, but fail to understand how the list is structured.
4.  Correct
