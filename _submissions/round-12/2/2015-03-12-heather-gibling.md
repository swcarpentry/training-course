## Multiple Choice Questions for Subsetting in R

My MCQs are based off the [Analyzing Patient Data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html) lesson on R Programming, starting more simply with vectors and then moving to matrices.

### Question 1
Given the following line of code used to generate vector 'x', how would you subset the first element?
`x <- c(10, 20, 30)`

A. `x(1)`
B. `x[1]`
C. `x[0]`
D. `X[1]`

### Question 2
Given the following line of code to generate matrix 'y', how would you subset the second row?
`y <- matrix(nrow=2, ncol=3, 1:6)`

A. `y[nrow=2]`
B. `y[2]` 
C. `y[,2]` 
D. `y[2,]`

#### Misconceptions

A. _the `nrow` argument is used in the function for generating the matrix, not in subsetting an object_
B. _this is the incorrect number of dimensions (1); there should be a comma to index both the row(s) and column(s) in the 2-dimensional matrix_
C. _the second column has been subset instead of the second row_
D. _correct answer_
