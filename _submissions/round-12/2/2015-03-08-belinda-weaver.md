The first MCQ relates to The Unix Shell http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-filedir.html

The second MCQ relates to Version Control with Git http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-backup.html

1) What command would you use to see all the files in your current working directory?

  a) ls -F

  b) ls -s

  c) pwd

  d) ls -a


2) What command would you use to start tracking a file in your Git repository?

  a) git status

  b) git diff

  c) git add

  d) git log

This is meant to test whether people remember they need to tell Git to track the file, which is done using the ‘git add’ command. People might think both ‘git status’ and ‘git log’ will give them useful information about files, but that is not what the question asked.
