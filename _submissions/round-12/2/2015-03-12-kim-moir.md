The multiple choice questions are based on material from the [Python lists lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/03-lists.html) 

q1. Given the following list definition:


    l = [2, 4, -3, 11, -1, 12]

What is the value of l[-1]?

    a. 4 
    b. 2 
    c. 12 
    d. not defined 

q2. Given the following code:

    l = [2, 4, -3, 11, -1, 12]
    l.reverse()
    l.append(13)

What is the value of l[-3]?

    a. -3 
    b. 3 
    c. 11
    d. 4

* a thinks append adds element the beginning of the list, not the end
* b thinks searching for -3 returns the position of the value -3 in the list
* c thinks -3 starts from the beginining of the list, not the end
* d is the correct answer
