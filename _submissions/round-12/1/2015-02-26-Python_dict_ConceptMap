When i started to learn Python few years ago, I remember I was not very familier with the concept of dictionary and avoided to use it, I decided to map out the so I decided to draw a concept map of built-in properties of dict (the properties from collections.defaultdict is not included).

Here is built in properties and methos of python mapping type container, dictionary.

![Concept map for SQL selection](https://www.dropbox.com/s/64y6ciq62iwhf1j/concept_map_Python_dict.png?dl=0)

It shows the built-in methods of dictionary in python.
<code>
SELECT <i>field_name, field_name</i> FROM <i>table_name</i>;
</code>
