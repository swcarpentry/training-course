This is a concept map for the learning objectives in [Programming with Python: Making Choices section](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/03-cond.html)

I have tried capture the basics of Python Conditional statements (if, elif, else) in the concept map. I think having the grasp of conditionals in Python gives the learner a great tool and hope the concept map helps a bit.
