I created a concept map that introduces the Unix shell, based off of [this lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/00-intro.html).

I attempted to encapsulate the entire lesson but ended up focusing primarily on Learning Objective #1 ("Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.").  

You can view the concept map here:
