I had my mind so set on making a concept map on Git branches after last week's meeting (because I spent a lot of time trying to determine the appropriate times to use branches) that I didn't really check to see if branches were covered in a SWC Git lesson... Turns out they aren't, really. There is a little bit of pushing/pulling in the [Collaboration Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-collab.html).

Here is my concept map:
