This is a concept map of how to manipulate (subset) data in R.

I made a few changes from [the lesson](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/r/01-starting-with-data.html) and covering similar ground to [this example](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2014/06/concept-map-subsetting-in-r/)--
I focused on "subsetting" rather than "manipulating" because at least within my head I think of 
the apply function as a second logical step after subsetting--first *subset* then *apply* a function to the
subset(s).  I also used the dplyr tools rather than the base R ones because I find that beginners get less frustrated compared to with the equivalent base R functions like .
