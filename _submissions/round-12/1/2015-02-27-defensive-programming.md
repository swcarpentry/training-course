Based on the last topic of the [Programming with MATLAB](https://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/) lesson, here is a concept map on [Defensive Programing](https://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/06-defensive.html). Emphasis is given to what Defensive Programing helps with and the role of assertions and conditions in that.
