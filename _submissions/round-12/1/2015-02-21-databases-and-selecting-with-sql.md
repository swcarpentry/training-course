I don't know much about SQL so when we were asked to create a concept
map based on a Software Carpentry lesson, I decided to map out the
main ideas and relationships in Software Carpentry's [introductory
lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/01-select.html)
on selecting data in SQL.

Here's the rough draft of the introductory SQL concept map.

It's meant to show the main elements of a relational database and
to introduce the SQL statement
<code>
SELECT <i>field_name, field_name</i> FROM <i>table_name</i>;
</code>
