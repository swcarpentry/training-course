This is a concept map for the first two learning objectives in the [Programming with R: Creating Functions section](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html)

I chose this topic because a lot of very deep concepts are introduced when we start teaching about functions, which were underappreciated by me when I was a student and first introduced to them. I have tried to draw the concept map I would end up with (and hope students would walk away with and refer to later) after teaching the SWC lesson.
