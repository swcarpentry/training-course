I found data frames in R a bit weird to understand first time I met them. Now
I think they are a very powerful and handy way to handle data, so I have tried
to put my insights in this concept map. Data frames are introduced in [this
lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html)
