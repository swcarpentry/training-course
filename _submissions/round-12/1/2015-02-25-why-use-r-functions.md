I developed this concept map based on the
[R functions lesson](swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html),
focusing mainly on the *reason* to use functions and less on the how
it is implemented.  I am focusing on the why because, at least for me,
if the student doesn't see the purpose to learning something, it won't
stick.  Sometimes the whys are more important than the hows.
