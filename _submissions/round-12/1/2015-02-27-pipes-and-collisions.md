I created a concept map for part of the Shell lessons, specifically [pipes in bash](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-pipefilter.html). In this map I've attempted to capture the purposes for using pipes as well as how they are used and what they are composed of.

1.  These two posts independently chose the same permanent link (permalink).
2.  Disqus uses permalinks to figure out which comments belong on which blog posts.
3.  So comments made before Feb 22 were showing up on Morgan's post...
4.  ...until Kristopher's post went up on Feb 26.

This sort of thing shouldn't be possible:
a well-engineered system wouldn't let human beings choose unique identifiers that might conflict with one another by accident.
I've "fixed" it by combining the two posts into one that has the permalink,
and changing the permalinks of the others to avoid conflict.
