Here is my concept map for pipes and filters. I wanted to convey the
difference between redirection and pipes. The [pipes and filters
lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-pipefilter.html)
demonstrated that both methods could be used to achieve the same
goals, but pipes required less intermediate steps.
