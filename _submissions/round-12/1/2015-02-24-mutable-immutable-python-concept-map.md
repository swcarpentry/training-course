Although simple, I think that this concept map might be useful for non-programmers.

I have found that these to variable types are often confused and can lead to important bugs not easy to find. I think that the example shown provides a context where this can easily be understood. Adding or removing dimensions "redefine" your system (notice the reference the classic book Flatland). Python also reallocates the memory address when you execute `coordinates +=(z)` whereas it does not when using a list.

This concept map links with [this lesson](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/python/04-cond.html) which explains the similarities and differences between tuples and lists.

Any comment is more than welcome ;)
