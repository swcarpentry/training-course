A concept map in order to get started with files and directories in a Unix Shell, described in [The Unix Shell: Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-filedir.html). I've mapped roughly the whole section, trying to give a sense of the commands that can be used to determine ones login identity, their present location, and how one may move around the directory structure to find files of interest and their composition.
