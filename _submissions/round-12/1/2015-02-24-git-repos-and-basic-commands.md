I created a concept map for the things which confused me in learning Git the first
time: the relationship between the repositories and some of the basic commands.

Please ignore the stuff in GREEN.  I wanted to keep in my mind what happens in the Working
Directory and drew that to remind myself.  Got a bit messy but it's for comments.
