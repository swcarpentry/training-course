A concept map for functions in Python, introduced in [Programming with Python: Creating Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/04-func.html). I've mapped the beginning of the lesson, covering the parts of a function, their names, and starting on composability. (I also included one or two things that I might mention if I talked about functions in Python for ten minutes, even though they weren't in the lesson explicitly.)
