My concept map illustrates the concept of test-driven development from the [Programming with Python - Defensive Programming](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/05-defensive.html) lesson.

Here is my updated sketch concept map.  As two commenters pointed out, the first attempt was a flow chart rather than a concept map!  More comments welcome.

Keeping my first try here linked for reference if anyone wants to take a look.
