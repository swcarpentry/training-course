I usually find that novices do not want to learn how to write function.
The main argument is that their code just works, so why learn a new concept?

They have a good argument there.  In order to introduce functions we to
overcome that prejudice by:

- teaching all the advantages that a function brings over a plain script/code block;
- show that functions are not a hard concept to grasp.

The lesson on [python functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/04-func.html)
does (1) well, and the simple concept map below might help with (2).
