The map below relates to the
[introductory R lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html) 
on variables and assignments.

It focuses on the assignment challenge in the middle of the lesson where the
following code snippet is given

```{.r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.0
age <- age - 20
```

and a simple visualization is sought. My attempt follows:

It illustrates the basic (initial) assignment and subsequent update via
multiplication and subtraction, respectively.
