*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*
initiating and/or cloning repositories in the correct directories. Sometimes I think I have done it correctly, but discover .git is located in my root directory instead.
I first learned about and began using Git in May of last year and am still getting myself in the habit of committing my files on a regular basis.
