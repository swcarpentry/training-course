[Martin Bentley](http://blog.martinb.za.net) is a MSc student at
Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, at Port Elizabeth, South
Africa. He is looking at airborne geophysical data, with a view
to making pretty pictures out of it.

A major side-project is the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org),
which aims to highlight difficulties
in obtaining access to the output of scholarly research. It is pretty
cool.

His reasons for doing the instructor training is largely selfish:
if the other people in his research institute can code, he can get on
with his own work, or at least solve more interesting problems that they
have.

In what spare time remains, he juggles, unicycles (preferably off-road)
and rock climbs. He also likes reading.
