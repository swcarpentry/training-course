[Martin Bentley](http://blog.martinb.za.net) is a MSc student at
Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, at Port Elizabeth, South
Africa. He is looking at airborne geophysical data, with a view
to making pretty pictures out of it.
A major side-project is the [Open Access Button]
(https://openaccessbutton.org), which aims to highlight difficulties
in obtaining access to the output of scholarly research. It is pretty
cool.
In what spare time remains, he juggles, unicycles (preferably off-road)
and rock climbs. He also likes reading.
