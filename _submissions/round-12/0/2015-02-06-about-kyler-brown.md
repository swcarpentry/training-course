What I found hardest about using Git the first time was:

+ Staging.
+ I remember being confused about pull requests, "_I'm trying to push to a repo, so why isn't it a push request?_"
+ The language of git uses a lot of independent metaphors that are bewildering at first. A repo has branches like a tree, a HEAD like an animal, a staging area like a... parade? 
+ Conflicts still trip me up, probably because most of my work is as a solitary programmer.
