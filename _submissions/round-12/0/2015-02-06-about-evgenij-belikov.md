I am [Evgenij Belikov](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~eb96/), a PhD candidate at the [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk/) in Edinburgh interested in Programming Languages and Parallel Computing. Currently, I'm working on parallelism management within a distributed run-time system for [Glasgow parallel Haskell](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/gph/). The run-time system is implemented in C and I use bash, Perl and R for automating measurements and data analysis. 

I enjoy Lab helping for various Computing Science courses and run a couple of introductory programming workshops for artists (Arduino and Processing). I am an Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/). I'm looking forward to improve my teaching, so I could help running SWC workshops, which I believe close a gap currently neglected in academia. In my spare time I enjoy mountaineering in the Scottish Highlands.
