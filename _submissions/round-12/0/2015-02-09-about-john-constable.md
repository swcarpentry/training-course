John Constable is a Systems Administrator at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
a genomics research charity near Cambridge, UK and the site that did a
large portion of the work on the Human Genome Project. 
John doesn't do enough system administration in code, but what he has done
has been in Perl, Python and CFEngine.
John was an invited speaker at the LISA 14 conference on the subject of storage 
system evaluation. He's fond of cake and talking about himself in the third person.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*
You'll laugh, but it was adding in a remote repository to push changes to,
along with the workflow of manging local commits vs the changes on the remote
master. 
I'm not that much of a git expert, having learned just enough for software
administration, rather than approaching from a coding point of view.
