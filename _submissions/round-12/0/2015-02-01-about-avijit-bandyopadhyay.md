*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*
Since I have experience with git and bitbucket (not github but almost the same),
this will be going from memory. My first time with git, although the mental 
model made sense, I had trouble with the git commands and doing "simple" things
like making atomic commits. In particular, I had trouble with git fetch/pull
from remotes into local. Once I got past that, I had issues with rewriting
history. It was quite alien to me that one could rewrite history in a 'code
repository'. I had a *lot* of trouble with rebasing and needed to spend a lot
of time undoing my mistakes. While it was a great way to learn, it certainly
wasn't good from an efficiency point of view.
