*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*
When I was first learning Git some years ago, I found it hard to figure out what a "detached HEAD" was, and how to avoid getting into that state, especially when working with a remote repository.  What made it difficult was that many explanations I found online relied on Computer Science analogies (mostly databases) that I as someone with physics background  was not familiar with. In the end I learned the "magic" flags that resolved the issue, but it took me longer to really understand what was happening.
