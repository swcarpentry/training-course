Hello everyone, I am a PhD student at Stony Brook University. My work mostly revolves around ecological networks ([check out my Github page here](https://github.com/jjborrelli)), with my current focus being the stability of the basic building blocks of food webs. I am familiar with R and in my own work I primarily use a numerical simulation based approach. Currently I am trying to add to my programming skill set by learning Python and JavaScript.
