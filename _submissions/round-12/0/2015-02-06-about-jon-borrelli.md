Hello everyone, I am a PhD student at Stony Brook University. My work mostly revolves around ecological networks ([check out my Github page here](https://github.com/jjborrelli)), with my current focus being the stability of the basic building blocks of food webs. I am familiar with R and in my own work I primarily use a numerical simulation based approach. Currently I am trying to add to my programming skill set by learning Python and JavaScript.   

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

... just using version control properly. Before I started using GitHub I had never even heard of version control. I was (and I am still) not very good at the write-save-commit workflow, instead making large changes to files (saving often) but only making a commit once when I was all done. This makes finding and merging any conflicts more difficult. I also had trouble when I first started because I was using the GitHub GUI and making the switch to command line was a challenge, but in the end, worthwhile.
