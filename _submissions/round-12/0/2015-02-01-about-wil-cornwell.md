[Will Cornwell](http://willcornwell.org) is an ecologist and a senior lecturer at UNSW in Sydney, Australia, interested in the functional diversity of plants.  He teaches a number of classes in field biology, especially focused on plants.  

He contributed to the R library called [picante](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/picante/picante.pdf), which is for various types of phylogenetic anlyses, and has a few projects that will likely be released as R libraries in the not-so-distant future--one is a [way to do fit different types of curves to organic matter decomposition trajectories](https://github.com/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterFitter) and the other is a way to [assess the adequacy of trait evolution models](https://github.com/richfitz/modeladequacy).  He is also interested in improving the reproducibility of scientific analysis; for an extended take on where software tools currently are see [a recent ROpenSci blog post](http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/06/09/reproducibility/).  

He's very interested in both new ways of communicating and demystifying technical subjects and especially any way to make all types of learning a more active experience.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

It was (and still is) hard for me to keep all possible git workflows in my head.  And when I started it was with a few different groups that used different workflows.  I feel like at the beginnning if I had learned one workflow very well and then gradually added all the git nuances and complexity it would have been a less frustrating learning experience.
