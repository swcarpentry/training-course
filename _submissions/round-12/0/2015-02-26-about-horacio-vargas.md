[Horacio Vargas] is a physicist that likes using engineers toolboxes to tackle research topics and make them useful. His education involves a strong background in physics, math, computer science and electronics. His main research interests are modeling soft matter and the explanation of its viscoelastic phenomena which implies the use of several simulation techniques in High-Performance-Computer environments, algorithms optimization, the use of CPU-GPU computing architectures, among others. He has been part of the computer scientist society in Bolivia, several European funded research projects and recently has become part of the Max Planck Society as a postdoctoral researcher.
 
Horacio is pursuing Software Carpentry instructor training because he enjoys teaching and I could see during my educational experience the relevance of a good guidance when facing new learning or intellectual challenges.
