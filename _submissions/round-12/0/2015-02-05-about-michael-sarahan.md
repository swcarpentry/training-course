*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

How to fix anything that wasn't exactly right the first time.  How to edit
commit messages, remove accidentally included files, and of course, rewriting
history to get rid of "extra" commits.  I also found the discipline of
remembering to start new branches for new projects difficult, but this isn't
specific to git - git just encourages branching more (for the better, IMHO).  A
lot of my issues with git were mixed up in also learning better self discipline
in when and what to commit.
