*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

The hardest part about learning `git` for the first time was trying to
understand branching. I kept hearing that it was `git`'s killer-feature, but I
had never figured out what I needed to use it for. Multiple timelines are
challenging enough to keep track of in science-fiction!

Seeing the branches visually by using `git log --graph` or `gitk` made
branching easier to understand.
