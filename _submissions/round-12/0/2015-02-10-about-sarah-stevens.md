[Sarah Stevens](https://sites.google.com/site/bactstevens/home) is a PhD candidate in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](http://www.microbiology.wisc.edu/) 
at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  She works in the McMahon Lab, using metagenomes 
and single-cell genomes to track microbial populations in two lakes in Wisconsin, 
Lake Mendota and Trout Bog Lake.

She is co-chair of [Molecular Microbial Ecology and Evolution (MoMiEE)](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/momiee/), a group which 
facilitates discussion of methods among researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison 
who study microbial ecology and evolution.  MoMiEE also contains a Python study group, which 
Sarah also organizes.  Sarah is very interested in communicating science and teaching 
researchers computational skills.

What I found hardest about using Git the first time was understanding which commands were 
for Git and which were for GitHub.  In this first exercise, what I struggled with was updating my 
branch with upstream, since you have to use `git checkout gh-pages` and `git merge upstream/gh-pages` 
where examples online instead use `git checkout master` and `git merge upstream/master`.  It 
took me a couple tries to realize I needed to use the gh-pages branch instead.
