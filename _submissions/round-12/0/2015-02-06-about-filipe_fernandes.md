*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

... I had some experience with SVN (Centralized) and Mercurial
(Decentralized) that made my transition to git a little bit smoother than
usual.  However, there are several git commands and actions that I found hard
to wrap my mind around, such as rebasing, cherry picking, squashing, etc.
Some of those I eventually got the hang of, while others I am only able to
execute like a "first time cooker" following a recipe.  If I had to summarized
I guess that what I found hardest about git is "its complexity to perform
tasks that were simple with SVN."
