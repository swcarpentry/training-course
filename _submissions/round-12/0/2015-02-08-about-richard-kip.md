*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

Understanding the workflow involved with a distributed version control system. 
I've been working with git and Github for around a year now, but it is very 
infrequent. This leaves be feeling like a perpetual beginner. My workflow is 
also very simple with everything tending to me in master.  Working with multiple 
repositories/branches makes my head hurt.
