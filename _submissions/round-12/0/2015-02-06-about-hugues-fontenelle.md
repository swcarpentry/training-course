My name is Hugues Fontenelle. I am a bioinformatician at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.
I'm working on the [Norwegian clinical genetic Analysis Platform (genAP)](http://www.med.uio.no/klinmed/english/research/projects/genap/), helping using High-Troughput Sequencing (HTS) in clinical practice. One of my research interests is the computational prediction of mutation effects on pre-mRNA splicing.
I'm originally trained as a computer engineer and I have a PhD in biomedical engineering.
