Round 12 of Software Carpentry instructor training kicked off
yesterday with three well-attended meetings --- the notes from
the Etherpad are below.  We will meet again on Thursday, Feb 19,
at the same times (10:00, 14:00, and 19:00 Eastern); between now
and then, please do the following:

1.  Read the first two chapters of *How Learning Works* (and if
    you picked up a copy of *Building a Better Teacher*, please
    try to get through that as well).

2.  Write a short post to this blog on GitHub describing yourself
    (details are below).

3.  Mail teaching12@lists.software-carpentry.org when your blog
    post is ready to be reviewed (so that we know you can send
    to the list, and so that others on the list have your email
    address in case they want to reach you directly).

4.  Read the
    [Software Carpentry Code of Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html).
    As noted in the meeting, we value the participation of every
    member of the scientific community and want all attendees to have
    an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.  Accordingly, everyone is
    required to show respect and courtesy throughout our workshops,
    online, and this training course.

5.  If you weren't able to make yesterday's meeting, or have *not* had
    mail from me either pairing you up with someone for Git tutoring
    or telling you to just go ahead and write your bio, please mail
    me: the Etherpad didn't record a couple of people's GitHub
    usernames, and a few people weren't able to make the meeting.

**Writing a Blog Post**

Previous rounds of instructor training used a WordPress blog.  As the
class grew, that became difficult to manage, so we are using a GitHub
blog this time instead.  To add a post to it, please submit a pull
request that creates a file called:

    _submissions/round-12/0/YYYY-MM-DD-about-YOUR-NAME.md

where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the publication date (e.g., `2015-02-01`),
`YOUR-NAME` is your name in lower case (e.g., `greg-wilson`), and the
`.md` at the end means the content is Markdown rather than HTML.  You
can create this post directly using GitHub's in-the-browser editor, or
by forking the
[https://github.com/swcarpentry/training-course](https://github.com/swcarpentry/training-course)
repository, adding the file to your clone, and sending a pull request.

If you don't know how to do this, *don't panic*: a third of
participants in this round have little or no experience with Git, and
another third rate their Git and GitHub knowledge as "middling".  We
have paired people up for one-to-one tutoring based on their
self-reported Git expertise; if you were partnered with someone, you
should have received a message introducing you to them, so please
arrange a time to chat online.  (We recommend that the novice share
their desktop with the tutor via something like Google Hangout, so
that the tutor can guide the novice through signing in, editing a
page, and so on, but we leave the mechanics up to each pair.)

If you weren't paired with someone, but would like some pointers,
please [mail Greg](mailto:gvwilson@software-carpentry.org) and he will
pair you up.  Please also mail
[the teaching12 list](mailto:teaching12@lists.software-carpentry.org) 
or [Greg](mailto:gvwilson@software-carpentry.org) if you would like
help, have questions, or would like to make suggestions.

Finally, if you have a few minutes and would like to make a
contribution to our materials, please:

1.  listen to
    [this browsercast](http://third-bit.com/browsercast/index.html)
    (which explains what a browsercast is), then

2.  listen to
    [this short introduction to Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/slideshows/introducing-software-carpentry/index.html),
    and then

3.  look at the other slideshows in
    [the slideshow repository](https://github.com/swcarpentry/slideshows),
    which haven't been polished or recorded yet,
    and either send us feedback or submit improvements.

Thanks once again for signing up - I'm looking forward to getting to
know you all.

- Greg
        

**Notes**

-   Running etherpad in a class helps the students!
    -   Student's ask questions in the chat area
    -   taking notes as a group
-   Educational psychology (EdPsych): Study of how people learn. Not
    enough to determine how to teach: problem is underconstrained:
    multiple ways of teaching are consistent.
    -   Includes everything from Neuropsychology: what the brain does
        when we are learning - Physical, in brain
    -   Sociological - definition of the goals of learning.
    -   Public school teachers are required to take lessons about
        teaching: not true with college instructors, who are experts
        in their field but not in teaching
        -   Like imagining that taking many flights makes a passenger a
            good pilot!
        -   Teaching is a learnable skill
-   Book recommendation: "How learning works" by Susan A. Ambrose et al
    -   <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468969206>
-   Question: Broadly speaking - as approaches to teach reading
    -   Phonics - Bottom up approach: assemble words from letters, then
        make sentences
    -   Whole language - Top Down approach: Teach the child to recognize
        whole words; not used so much today but rather common in the
        1950's
        -   Can start reading whole words sooner, street signs, simple
            stories, &c
        -   Good motivation early
-   EdPsych: Under constrains teaching--many ways to teach that are
    consistent with our knowledge of how learning works.
    -   Educational Psychology is akin to science.
    -   Need instructional design: akin to engineering. There are many
        approaches that are supported by the science of Educational
        Psychology, but you need to test out what works.
-   If you're using something like an Etherpad or a chat for a class,
    don't ask "are there questions", but offer multiple choices of
    responses.
-   Examples of 2 approaches to teaching how to read:
    -   Most popular teaching method, bottom up approach to reading, is
        phonics
        -   The phonics approach is hierarchical -\> could imagine in
            coding the analogy would be syntax to functions to flow
            statements
    -   Whole language teaching teaches children how to recognize words as
        ideograms first before explaining particular letters, e.g. "cat",
        "stop". Top down approach.
        -   Dr. Seuss used whole language approach
-   Does not matter which method you use - enthusiasm of the teacher is
    more important than anything else - study in 1952 conducted for the
    British Ministry of Education
-   Method used is insignificant - enthusiasm is most relevant
    -   Excitement from teacher is something that goes across well. Boredom
        from an instructor will lead to poor results. Students interpret lack of
        enthusiasm as the subject matter is not important to learn/know.
-   Novelty of method seems to be what determines success, because it is
    what excites the teacher
-   Enthusiasm does not scale.
-   "Yet another curriculum" does not necessarily motivate teachers
-   Needs to be a sustainable approach to the design of how things are
    taught.
-   When it comes to computing, less Instructional design material available
    for computing
-   Less focus on computational teaching in computing science
    departments, compared to other disciplines (e.g. language, physics,
    math) = less material that is directly useable for us
-   We're going to 'borrow' results (and hope they work)
-   Analogy to language acquisition
    -   Phonics - giving people the component pieces to write their own
        code,
    -   Whole Language - starting learners with small, functional programs
        and using to develop their skills
-   With SWC we are lucky enough to have learners who are already motivated
    and interested in the material, and it is one of our primary
    responsibilities not to demotivate them
-   Teaching is a performance.
    -   In software carpentry we have teachers that use both methods - you have
        to figure out which one works best for you (and for the learners)
    -   gvwilson will buy you an improv class!!
    -   1980's study by Patrica Benner on how nurses become more competent
        (books available on Amazon)
-   Three type of learners: (full model has more (5), but these are useful
    enough)
-   Novice: (no/limited facts)
    -   don't know what they don't know
        -   No such thing as pure, uninterpreted knowledge
    -   no mental model/map
        -   So novices will often try to apply inappropriate (or wrong!)
            models
        -   Like using a highway analogy for the internet
        -   packing gobs of knowledge into the wrong model -
            counterproductive
        -   Don't have right boxes.
    -   Questions they ask won't make sense; they are not even wrong
        -   Need context (map/model) to ask domain appropriate
            questions
        -   <http://xkcd.com/1425/>
    -   Will take a mental model from their experience and try to apply
        it to the new area - but likely to be misapplying that model
    -   Our goal is *emphatically* not to overload with information -
        because this can *reduce* how much they learn
    -   We need to give them a useful model and landmarks of the
        problem
        -   doesn't need to be complete!!!
    -   don't reinforce their incorrect model
        -   They (might) have something that more or less works, but it
            might not match reality.
        -   once they have a model we can fill it with details
    -   Our aim: Trying to get novices to the point where they can ask
        useful questions (ex SO), and then recognize useful answers (on
        SO) and learn on their own (e.g. through StackOverflow)
        -   Not turning scientists into Web developers
    -   Hard to google if you don't even know the question (+ keywords)
    -   this is a "bait and switch" approach to teaching - we offer people
        "we'll teach you R/git/Python/etc" and use that to smuggle in a few
        basic concepts
-   Competent: (yes facts, but rigid connection between them)
    -   Has an accurate mental model of the domain
    -   Can do routine tasks without significant effort.
    -   That's the level we want to bring our participants to
    -   Recognize a useful answer when it comes up
-   Expert: (yes facts, and many, many different connections between
    them)
    -   Experts have more connections between the facts that they know,
        more direct connections
    -   Experts can go straight from A - G because of extra linkages,
        Competent must go A-B-C-D-E-F-G.
        -   This makes it more difficult for experts to teach, because
            they've short-circuited the model in a way that a novice
            can't yet understand, and when they try and teach it, they
            include steps that don't make sense
    -   I think the point about experts having to fabricate a path to
        answer very valuable. I struggle with this.
    -   people become experts when they practice deliberately and
        reflectively
    -   We know less about 'expertise' than about 'novice' and
        'competent' levels
    -   Harder to study
    -   People know facts.Think of these as nodes, which can be linked
        to each other.
    -   Expert blindness - forget to "unsee" what they previously saw as
        competent/novice
    -   What seems common in distinguishing Expert from Competent is you
        have many more links between their knowledge - so smaller number
        of 'hops' through your knowledge 'graph' to get to the answer
    -   This maybe the cause of Experts being less good at teaching -
        they shortcut the reasoning that a novice or competent person
        would go through
    -   Seem to have intuition to solve a problem and leap to the answer
    -   How to get to this level?
        -   previously thought 10k h of training but wrong
        -   not enough to repeat but reflecting of what is done
        -   Reflective / deliberate practice: Critical thinking
-   To become Expert:
    1.  Get feedback on work (e.g. feedback to your written texts, at
        school... etc)
    2.  Start giving feedback to others (book reviews, analysis of
        existing work)
    3.  The magic happens: Analytic machinery is turned inwards, so
        you start giving yourself realtime feedback.
        -   Reflecting on **how** to do something
        -   Ability to perform suddenly spikes upward. Learning curve
            accelerates.
        -   Stop thinking about tasks in mechanical terms and start
            improving output directly.
-   Code review is good example for this
    -   getting and giving feedback
    -    helps to reflects and to develop expertise.
-   Code review can be made to scale.
-   Like teaching a child to play piano
    -   at first she perceives it as a mechanical exercise
    -   eventually she starts to *hear* her music.
-   Our job (SWC) is to get people from novice to competent. Expertise
    is not really part of it.
    -   Teaching is not conveying information, it is a performance art
-   SWC does care about expertise in teaching, but the goal of this
    course is to get everyone at least to competent.
-   Benefits of code review:
    -   other people will see bugs you don't
    -   you will learn new things by looking at their code, and they will
        learn new stuff from your
    -   you will learn to critique your code as you write it (giving
        yourself feedback in real time)
-   Teachers spend time in other teachers classroom to watch and learn
    (Finland, Poland, Japan, Korea)
    - Sharing lesson ideas (culturally ingrained)
-   In US - teacher has another teacher in class 6 hours a year; in
    Finland it is 4 hours a week!
-   In improving a school system, peer comments works very well -
    showing people how to improve is a common thread in successful
    school systems (e.g. Japan, Finland)
-   In healthy Open Source communities, there is healthy interaction and
    feedback: by teaching other people to code better, the overall
    project does better.
-   Code review: thinking critically about other's code builds skills
    and habits to think critically about your own
-   Software Carpentry's github repositories host discussions for
    similar feedback
-   There is a Software Carpentry Code of Conduct both online and
    offline
-   We're have to make people feel welcome, because if they don't
    they're not going to learn.
-   encourage people to sign up in groups, so that you know that there
    are other people around you who know as little as you do
-   having a "wingman" makes you feel more secure in a novel learning
    environment
-   SWC workshops where people signed up in groups, there was:
    -   better gender parity and also
    -   better representation of our main target group: people with weak computer skills.
-   Some start-ups that aim to give feedback on teaching
    -   <https://www.beasmartercookie.com/>
    -   <http://www.edthena.com/>
-   Similar approach was used to learn instruments. Very important to
    have a healthy, supportive, troll-free community.
-   Culture of mutual reflection - give each other feedback - pick good
    ideas - lead to better teaching
-   2-3% female participation on stackoverflow / github due to
    hostile, harsh environment (overall industry has around 15% female
    participants)
-   Get people to sign up in small groups. Go with lab-mates/friends.
-   Means that you know that other people are on the same level as you.
-   People are more likely to show up if people around you are those you
    can trust.
-   Software Carpentry had the experience that if people signed up in group
    the gender ratio was nearly 50/50 and that more people who were complete
    novices were signing up.
-   Charging for events also cuts no-show rate from 25% to 5%
-   Studies have shown that after 45 to 90 minutes the
    ability to transfer from short-term to long-term memory will decrease
    significantly. Citation possibly:

    or <http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED335141.pdf>
-   Unfortunately, we are spread out, so people doing the workshops need to
    fly around, so for time reasons and cost/travel limitations, we stick to
    shorter, intensive formats.
    -   Feel free to do more if it is local.
    -   Can also go too far the other way, with classes spread over too much
        time.
    -   Four half-days seems to be optimal.
        -   (what might be done in 5 half days, just to make it a round week?)
-   We do not use slides (except for diagrams/schematics - NOT for coding)
    but simply start coding. People then see that the teacher also makes
    mistakes (so it's OK for the student to screw up) and how he/she gets
    out of the problem. Additional benefit is, it slows us down can take in
    the information better.
-   you can be more responsive than with a slide deck
