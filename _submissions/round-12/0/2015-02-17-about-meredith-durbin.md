My name is [Meredith Durbin](http://meredith-durbin.com). I am a Research and Instrument Analyst at [STScI](http://www.stsci.edu/), where I work on the maintenance and calibration of Hubble's [Wide Field Camera 3](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/). I have a bachelor's in physics from [Pomona College](http://www.pomona.edu/) Having started my undergraduate degree with no programming experience whatsoever, I am very interested in making resources and training options for scientific programming more widely available; I wish I had encountered something like SWC in my first year of college!
