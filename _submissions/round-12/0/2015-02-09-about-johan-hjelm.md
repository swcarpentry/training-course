I am a Senior Research Scientist at the Department of
Energy Conversion and Storage at the Technical University of Denmark
([DTU Energy](http://www.energy.dtu.dk/english)).
My main research interests lie in the area of electrochemical science and
technology. I am is also interested in scientific computation and open
and reproducible research.

After being introduced to Python by a colleague I am now using Python for
data processing, analysis, and visualization since a few years. I have some
experience with Linux/Bash as well. I am looking forward to learn more
about teaching in general and about how to best help others learn about programming and
good coding practices.
