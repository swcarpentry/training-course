I am a Senior Research Scientist at the Department of
Energy Conversion and Storage at the Technical University of Denmark
([DTU Energy](http://www.energy.dtu.dk/english)).
My main research interests lie in the area of electrochemical science and
technology. I am is also interested in scientific computation and open
and reproducible research.

After being introduced to Python by a colleague I am now using Python for
data processing, analysis, and visualization since a few years. I have some
experience with Linux/Bash as well. I am looking forward to learning more
about teaching in general and about how to best help others learn about programming and
good coding practices.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

I have no experience with version control systems, so it took a while to
figure out what a pull request is, I still have a lot to learn I think, and am not
really sure what the difference between a fork and a branch is. I am using Git
from the command line, and as it was hard to remember all new commands
I used an IPython Notebook for most of the work flow, this made it easier I think.
Haven't tried rebasing, squashing etc. I found a graphical interface that
illustrates branches etc ('gitg'), this was helpful too.
