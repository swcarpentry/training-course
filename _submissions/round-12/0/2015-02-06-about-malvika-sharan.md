I am Malvika Sharan, a bioinformatics PhD candidate in the Institute for Molecular Infection Biology at the University of Wuerzburg, Germany. I am involved in projects that deal with automated function prediction of proteins and high throughput sequencing data analysis. I mainly use Python, shell and R to address my project related issues.

I value the integration of softwares and informatics to carry out science more effectively. In near future, I want to get involved in teaching informatics to the biologists through community driven unseminars in my University. I am looking forward to learning about how efficient teaching works so that I can train myself in this direction in more practical manner.
