I currently am developing software for the CALIPSO project at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.  This project uses a satellite based LIDAR to characterize and track clouds and aerosols.

Not only would I like to help scientists improve their software skills, but I would like to apply the ideas that I learn in this course to teaching in other areas such as English as a Second Language.
