I'm a PhD Candidate with the Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. My project is trying to tease apart the fall migration ecology of [rails](http://aurielmvfournier.com/2013/07/field-season-2013-five-rails-the-who-behind-the-why/) and how wetland management in Missouri impacts them. So I spent three months of the year on an ATV in Missouri counting/following and other wise looking for rails. more info [here](http://aurielmvfournier.com/2014/07/wetland-management-and-rails/).

I use R every day for statistical modeling, data management, and other projects. I find myself more and more trying to help others with R and I struggle with how best to help them. I'm going through training because I want to learn how to teach people about R in a way that is more then me just taking over their computer. We're having an SWC workshop at UA this spring, and I am hoping once I'm through training we can make it a more regular thing, there are many students just in my dept, much less on campus, who would benefit. 

I have been using github for several months, but just through the GUI (which I realize makes no sense, since I am constantly on my peers about getting away from GUIs). What I found hardest about using Git the first time was feeling like I was back at square one again and remembering how hard it is to do anything when you have no idea what to type. I also wasn't able to find help online that really answered my questions so I never had much confidence in what I was typing. As a result, I'm still doing this all throught the browser or GUI since I can't find instructions that actually show the entire process.
