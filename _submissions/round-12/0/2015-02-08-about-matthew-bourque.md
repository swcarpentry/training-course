[Matthew Bourque](https://github.com/bourque) is Data Analyst at
[Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu/) (STScI) in 
Baltimore, Maryland where he works on detector calibrations and 
characterizations for the [Wide Field Camera 3](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3)
(WFC3) instrument on Hubble Space Telescope, as well as maintains an extensive
filesystem and database for all on-orbit WFC3 data. He received a B.S. in
Astronomy/Astrophysics from the 
[Florida Institue of Technology](http://www.fit.edu/) in 2011 and is currently
pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at 
[Towson University](http://www.towson.edu/). Matthew's interests primarily lie
in scientific computing, but he is also a big supporter of open source and
collaborative programming.  Matthew is excited to develop teaching skills and
learn best practices that will help him spread programming knowledge and
skills to others in various analytical fields.

What I found hardest about using Git for the first time was the fact that a 
branch is snapshot of the entire repository rather than a separate set of 
physical files. Learning Git as a SVN user, it was a bit difficult to
understand that a particular file can exist in several different states, yet be
stored in the same location within the repository.  As a result, I often found
myself accidentally modifying files under the incorrect branch.

I have now been using Git and Github for a little over two years and now have
a good understanding of the Git model.  However, most of my work on Git/Github
has been in an individual effort, so working on remote repositories with
other collaborators is a new avenue for me.
