*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

I am using git and github in my daily work for my own projects and am
familiar with those basics. I still can remember that I had problems
when moving from CVS to git many years ago but honestly I don't know
exactly anymore what those were. Still, I often have to go back to the
documentation when I have to sync my local fork with changes in the
upstream repository.
