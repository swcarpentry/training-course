[Peter Fields](http://www.peterdfields.com/) is a post-doc in the lab of Dieter Ebert at the University of Basel, Switzerland. His work in the Ebert lab focuses on the population genomics of the species *Daphnia magna*, a crustacean. Peter received his PhD in Biology from the University of Virginia, where he was a member of Douglas Taylor's lab.
