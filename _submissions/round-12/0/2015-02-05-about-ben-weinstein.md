Hello everyone. I'm a PhD student at Stony Brook University studying hummingbird biogeography and community ecology. I currently live in Portland, Oregon.

My work involves a wide variety of technical platforms. I am interested in High Performance Computing in R and am currently working with the XSEDE Stampede cluster. My work also tries to bring tools from computer vision into biology ([recent paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12320/abstract)). 

I am passionate about teaching R and Python, and designed/taught a [course](http://benweinstein.weebly.com/r-course.html) last year for graduate students in my dept.

I'm looking forward to learning alot more about evidence-based teaching!
