Stephanie is in the first year of her graduate studies at the
University of Toronto in Canada where she is looking at large data
sets to understand how genomes evolve. She was introduced to
computational biology during an exchange semester at Osaka University
in Japan and developed a strong interest in programming and
computational methods. She also has a degree in music performance,
another of her passions.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

...the idea that the SWC repository is different from what is on my
own GitHub account and that any changes I make on my account have to
be pushed and merged to the copy in the SWC repository. This is
different from my understanding of other cloud-based services like
Google Drive that save the changes that you make to shared projects in
real time. However, I can see that it would be a good idea to have to
actively push changes to the shared copy so you can keep track of what
changes were made and when. So I suppose I'm starting to wrap my head
around the benefits of version control...I am also finding some of the
terminology a bit confusing. For example, what's the difference
between a 'branch' and a 'fork?'
