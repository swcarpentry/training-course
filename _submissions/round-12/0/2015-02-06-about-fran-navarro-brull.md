Fran Navarro is the co-founder of [CAChemE](http://cacheme.org),
nonprofit organization of chemical engineers, 
both professionals of the industry and academics,
aiming to encourage the new software possibilities in the area of process engineering.
He's currently a PhD candidate at the University of Alicante (Spain)
while his background studies are Chemical Engineering
and Material Science. At the moment, he researches within
the framework of a European Project called [MAPSYN](http://mapsyn.eu), in which
he is responsible for the mathematical modeling and computer
multiphysics simulation of microreactors. Previously, during his
studies, he also worked for a year at Bayer Technology Services
(Germany) as a data analyst.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*
Precisely, to pull the changes from the original (forked)
repository. There were to many new concepts and it was difficult to configure
the upstream properly (pull didn't work out of the box). 
On the other hand, reverting file changes in case of conflict
was also painful and I found myself, copying new files in other location
and deleting the repository in order to forking it again.
This time was surprisingly easier, but now I have a better understanding of
git, branching (learned thanks to swcarpentry) and the nomenclature which 
could be complex for a non-native English speaker ;)
