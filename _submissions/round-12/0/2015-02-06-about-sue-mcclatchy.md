Sue McClatchy is a bioinformatician and research program manager at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. 
She teaches a research course to talented high school students who don't know that they shouldn't know
how to do quantitative trait locus analysis. It's good they don't know this - they're fearless.
She entered genomics after a first career as a K-12 teacher, in which she taught Advanced Placement Biology
at private American schools in Latin America. Now she has the best of both careers - great students
and a really interesting research lab setting.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was the terminology. I understand the words push and pull for example, but don't understand what they mean in this context.*
