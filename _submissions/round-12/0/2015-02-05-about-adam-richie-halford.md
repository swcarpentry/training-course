*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

...its differences from SVN. I had some familiarity with SVN when I
first started using Git. I tried to apply my previous experience with
SVN workflows to a Git workflow. This was initially confusing because
in Git there are many more places where the "source" can exist. This
is a great example of the "inappropriate prior knowledge" that Susan
Ambrose discusses in [How Learning Works](http://amzn.com/0470484101).
For simple, local Git workflows, the SVN workflow serves as a useful
analogy for a Git workflow. For example, both SVN and Git have `add`
and `commit` commands. But the analogy breaks down when one starts to
consider the *distributed* Git workflow. Borrowing Ambrose's jargon
once more, learning git became much easier for me once I understood the
"conditions of applicability" of my prior experience with SVN.
