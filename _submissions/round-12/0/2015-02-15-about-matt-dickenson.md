*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

Understanding the terminology, especially the differences between "forks" and "branches." Github's UI tacitly encourages forking repos, when often branching is the better practice. I now use Git daily for my work. Typically I prefer the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow for web development projects. I use Git on the command line and have several command aliases to save time and keystrokes.
