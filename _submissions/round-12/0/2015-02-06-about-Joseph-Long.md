[Joseph Long](http://joseph-long.com) is a research analyst at the
[Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu/), where he works on flexible [optical simulation tools](https://pythonhosted.org/poppy/) for the upcoming [JWST](http://jwst.nasa.gov/) (among other necessary things for putting robot telescopes in space). He studied physics at [Pomona College](http://www.pomona.edu/), was a [hackNY Fellow](http://hackny.org/) in 2013, and has used computing in contexts from astronomical instrumentation to high-throughput data processing. Several years of watching progress in computing both within and without academia made him think we need to improve computing training for scientists, and he's excited to join in Software Carpentry's mission to do just that.
