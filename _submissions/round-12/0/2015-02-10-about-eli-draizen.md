My name is Eli Draizen and I am a computational biologist interested in protein structure evolution and infectious diseases. Currently I am a postbac at the NCBI near Washington, DC. I received my B.S. in Bioinformatics last fall from UC Santa Cruz, and up until January I was working at Berkeley Labs. Next fall, I will start a PhD program. When I am not in lab, you can find me backpacking in Yosemite or playing drums for a few indie bands.

I use Python for most of my work and want to learn how to teach it effectively. While at UCSC, I had the opportunity to help teach an introductory bioinformatics class and at Berkeley Labs, I was able to be a helper for a SWC boot camp. These experiences made me understand how important and difficult teaching can be, so I am looking forward to improving my teaching skills.
