I'm a PhD student in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the
University of Toronto.  My research involves the epidemiology of
diabetes and understanding potential associations with serum fatty
acids.  I find it extremely exciting to do analyses, learning about
statistical techniques and about programming in general.  I am a
(sometimes evangelical) Linux user and have recently had a renewed
interesting in learning all things R (like the incredible knitr and
dplyr packages).

My reason for doing this instructor training is because it troubles me
that researchers (and those in-training) are not taught on the proper
use of programming techniques and concepts.  Given our increasing
reliance on basic programming techniques and understanding in data
analysis, the more researchers we train the better the science will be
and the more productive they will become.  Doing this training will
show me the best ways to teach researchers these concepts.

I (occasionally) write on my
[blog](http://lwjohnst86.github.io/about/) when I am not busy doing
analyses.
