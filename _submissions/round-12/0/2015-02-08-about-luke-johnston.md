I'm a PhD student in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the
University of Toronto.  My research involves the epidemiology of
diabetes and understanding potential associations with serum fatty
acids.  I find it extremely exciting to do analyses, learning about
statistical techniques and about programming in general.  I am a
(sometimes evangelical) Linux user and have recently had a renewed
interesting in learning all things R (like the incredible knitr and
dplyr packages).

My reason for doing this instructor training is because it troubles me
that researchers (and those in-training) are not taught on the proper
use of programming techniques and concepts.  Given our increasing
reliance on basic programming techniques and understanding in data
analysis, the more researchers we train the better the science will be
and the more productive they will become.  Doing this training will
show me the best ways to teach researchers these concepts.

I (occasionally) write on my
[blog](http://lwjohnst86.github.io/about/) when I am not busy doing
analyses.

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

I've been using Git daily for the last year.  Git was my first
exposure to version control, so there was no unlearning for me.  Given
that, the hardest part about Git was *getting myself to actually start
using it*.  I had frequently read that Git was sometimes confusing and
difficult, and so I was apprehensive about starting to use it, mainly
because I didn't always have time to devote to learning something new.
However, having used it for a full year now, I can say that Git has
actually be a lot more enjoyable (for me) compared to other
experiences I've had with statistical coding.  Maybe the warnings
about Git mentally prepared me for it, but, I wish I had of started
sooner (TBH, I stalled in using it for about 2-3 months, so not that
long).
