[Vladimir Sudilovsky](http://www.vsudilovsky.com) is a lifelong student and enthusiast of software and science. He received his PhD in astrophysics in Munich, Germany, but is now happily employed as a web developer at the [ADS](http://ui.adslabs.org). He has seen first hand how the best practices and philosophies from the software world can improve academic research. He would like to see that every researcher has the ability to leverage modern computing for their benefit.

Though I learned Git as my first VCS and picked up reasonable workflows for a sole developer relatively quickly, I realized that the common patterns for collaborating with others on the same code base was (at the time) less documented. Though I had a solid theoretical understanding of branches, origin/upstream, and merges, it took actually using these concepts/tools for me to solidfy my understanding.
