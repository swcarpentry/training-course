*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

I was a long time CVS and SVN user. The biggest challenges were moving
away from the mental model of central repositories, managing branches
in a single working copy and managing remote repositories. After
becoming familiar with Git, I switched a project with multiple
collaborators from SVN to Git and my intuition was that the Git model
would result in complete confusion. My intuition was completely
wrong. I now, of course, can't even remember how SVN and CVS
work. More recently, I've been working on a project that uses
Mercurial. This has proved to be enormously painful because I am
entirely confused by its branching model and when to use the bookmarks
etc. I really like Git's lightweight branching compared with Mercurial
(I acknowledge that this is due to my lack of familiarity with
Mercurial and that both systems seem entirely similar to most).
