[Owen Stephens](http://ostephens.com) is a consulting librarian working in the UK, helping libraries, and their members, exploit computers and information technology. Currently Owen is working on projects related to online [Historical Texts](http://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk), online [Journal Archives](http://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/), helping institutions [monitor open access publications](http://jiscmonitor.jiscinvolve.org/) and [track online resources](http://gokb.kuali.org). 

Owen organised the first [Mashed Library](http://www.mashedlibrary.com) - a series of unconferences for people interested in libraries and technology.

He feels awkward writing about himself in the third person and I blog at [Overdue Ideas](http://www.meanboyfriend.com/overdue_ideas).
