[Owen Stephens](http://ostephens.com) is a consulting librarian working in the UK, helping libraries, and their members, exploit computers and information technology. Currently Owen is working on projects related to online [Historical Texts](http://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk), online [Journal Archives](http://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/), helping institutions [monitor open access publications](http://jiscmonitor.jiscinvolve.org/) and [track online resources](http://gokb.kuali.org). 

Owen organised the first [Mashed Library](http://www.mashedlibrary.com) - a series of unconferences for people interested in libraries and technology.
He feels awkward writing about himself in the third person and I blog at [Overdue Ideas](http://www.meanboyfriend.com/overdue_ideas).

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

Becoming familiar with, and remembering, terminology and commands. Everytime I wanted to do something I found myself having to go back and look up the documentation. My use of Git and Github tends to be at a very basic level. I've only occasionally used them to collaborate on code, and more commonly used them for personal version control and sharing code online. I got over the initial hurdle by using a simple GUI client instead of relying on the command line. I think the first one I tried was [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com) but I then found [GitBox](http://gitboxapp.com) which I liked (and it helped it was substantially cheaper than Tower!). I still use GitBox for the most straightforward tasks such as:

* Creating/Adding new repositories
* Committing changes with messages
* Creating new branches

But when I need to do more than this, it's back to the documentation and the command line :)
