_What I found hardest using Git the first time was..._

I'm pretty new to Git.  I took a SWC workshop last summer which included
a section on Git but it went really fast, so this is basically the 
first time for me. I found it hard to get a clear sense of the relationship
between the master (upstream) swc repo, my forked copy on GitHub, and my
cloned copy on my desktop. It's also hard to get straight the different pull,
add, commit, etc commands which have to be carried out within a given copy
of the repo (local desktop, forked copy on GitHub?) and between different 
copies of the repo (btw desktop and origin, btw orgin and upstream, btw
desktop and upstream?). I also find the GitHub interface confusing, looks
nice, but confusing for a novice.
