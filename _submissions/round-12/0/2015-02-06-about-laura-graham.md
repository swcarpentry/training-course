*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*
I tend to use git for keeping version control on my own work, and I mainly use it through the RStudio interface. As such, I do not have a clear picture of the overall model, or fully understand the terminology, of Git and GitHub. In this exercise, I was confused about the usage of (and the difference between) branches and forks. Any advice on how to get a fuller understanding of Git and GitHub is much appreciated!
