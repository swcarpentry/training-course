I am a current master’s student in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science ([GSLIS](https://www.lis.illinois.edu/)) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in data curation and analytics.  I am also the co-organizer of Champaign Urbana’s Python User Group ([PyCU](http://py-cu.github.io/)) where I’ve led several Python workshops.  I am particularly interested in teaching programming and software skills to graduate students and researchers from non-STEM backgrounds, especially the social sciences and humanities.  I am completing this training as part of an independent study where I am evaluating technology education for library science students and participating as a TA for the current Python programming class within that program.
