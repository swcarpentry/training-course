#Remi Daigle

I am a marine ecologist interested in larval ecology, ocean health, and the design of marine protected areas. I am currently a postdoc at the University of Toronto and McGill conducting research with Marie-Josée Fortin and Frédéric Guichard. My research focuses on the optimization of networks of marine protected areas for sea cucumbers on Canada’s west coast using biophysical modelling and MARXAN.

I use R for my day to day computing needs, but I also have some experience with MATLAB, Fortran, and Linux/Bash. I also taught R as part of my Intertidal Ecology class at Dalhousie University and I uploaded my R tutorial to [GitHub](https://github.com/remi-daigle/R_tutorial_ocean). My students really enjoyed the R aspect of my classe and I'm really looking forward to further improving my teaching abilities!
