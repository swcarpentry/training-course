Ariel Bowers has been working at the Space Telescope Science Institute
(STScI) for a little over a year now as a Research Instrument Analyst where she works on detector callibrations and characterization for the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope.  She recieved her B.A. in Computer Science with minors in French and Space Science & Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2013.  She is also in process of completing her Master's degree in Space Systems Engineering.  Ariel's interest include databases and scientific computing.  Ariel is very excited to get involved with SWC and to help teach others good programming and version control practices.

I was pretty comfortable with basic workflow of git when I learned it.  However, once I become comfortable with it and learned all the other funtionalities (git checkout, git branch, git reset, etc.) it had that's when it got pretty difficult for me.  It was challanging for to see how to use these commands properly to acheive the results you wanted.
