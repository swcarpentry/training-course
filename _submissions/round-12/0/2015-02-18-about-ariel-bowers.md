I was pretty comfortable with basic workflow of git when I learned it.  However, once I become comfortable with it and learned all the other funtionalities (git checkout, git branch, git reset, etc.) it had that's when it got pretty difficult for me.  It was challanging for to see how to use these commands properly to acheive the results you wanted.
