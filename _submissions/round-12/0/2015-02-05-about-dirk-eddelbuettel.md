[Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com) has been contributing to
[Debian](http://www.debian.org) as a developer / maintainer for almost two
decades. Most of his open source focus these days centers around
[R](http://www.r-project.org) to which he has been contributing for well
over a decade. He works in Chicago as a senior quantitative analyst, and
holds a PhD in Mathematical Economics from [EHESS](http://www.ehess.fr/en/ehess).
