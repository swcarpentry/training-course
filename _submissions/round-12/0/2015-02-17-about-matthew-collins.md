*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

...figuring out why my branches didn't get pushed to a remote origin. I had conceptualized that every copy of a git repository was complete so it just didn't make sense that when I made a branch and then ran just `git push` and `git pull` somewhere else, that my branch didn't show up on the other machine. This is my own personal example of a knowledge graph that was *wrong*.
