_Reason for taking part in Software Carpentry..._

I had the opportunity to mentor a few co-op students last year as well as teach a few seminars and I found it a very rewarding experience. I would also like to meet people in the same field who have similar interests.

_What I found hardest about using Git for the first time_

Determining whether to 'pull' or 'checkout' a branch. If you're creating a new branch, you 'checkout -b'. But if the branch already exists locally and remotely, you 'pull'. If it only exists remotely, you 'checkout'. If you want to switch to an existing branch, you 'checkout'. If you want to wipe all of your changes, you 'checkout'. If you want to merge what's remote with what's local, you 'pull'. This took me a long time to figure out, since I came from Subversion where you simply 'commit'.
