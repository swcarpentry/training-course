Group 7 met for the first time yesterday; 41 people attended, and three sent apologies, so it&#8217;s shaping up to be the largest cohort we&#8217;ve ever had. Notes are below (along with a warning about upcoming disruptions in the time-space continuum); the first exercise is to create some concept maps, and we&#8217;ll meet again in two weeks if Greg&#8217;s teaching schedule permits it.

**Notes:**

*   Welcome
*   Four things you need to know: 
    *   A lot of smart people have spent decades studying learning and education, and we&#8217;ll be better teachers if we base our practices on what they&#8217;ve discovered 
        *   Few university-level instructors know any of this.
        *   [*How Learning Works* is an excellent summary][2]
    *   Learning isn&#8217;t just about knowing more, it&#8217;s about thinking differently 
        *   changing how people see the problem, &#8220;change behaviour&#8221;
        *   good/strong/varied connections between information
        *   learning how to learn
    *   Teaching is a performance art 
        *   &#8220;Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity&#8221;
        *   Make them want to care about what they are learning, and how they can use it
        *   personal motivation is of paramount importance for students&#8217; learning &#8211; how to encourage that motivation?
        *   Software Carpentry focuses on what&#8217;s instantly usable by students.Two days isn&#8217;t much time to change behaviours.
        *   These curriculum items aren&#8217;t what might be most important in computing in a general sense.
        *   addendum: &#8220;It&#8217;s what the students are doing that counts&#8221; &#8211; E. Prather.
    *   Greg is still learning this stuff himself 
        *   Feel free (and encouraged) to make corrections/additions to the material!
*   Goals of the course 
    *   Get you ready to improvise (because you&#8217;re going to have to) 
        *   Every audience is different, therefore we need to be able to adapt to the audience and conditions
        *   diverse audience = variety of needs and backgrounds, need to adapt your materials to your audience, adapt to questions
    *   Familiarize you with what Software Carpentry teaches, how, and why 
        *   sticky-notes, whiteboards, kinds of questions that work or not&#8230;
        *   Our [GitHub repositories][3]
    *   Build bonds with your fellow instructors 
        *   pair/group activities
        *   observing each other, giving each other feedback: peer reviewing leads to better product and speeds things up
        *   interesting stat: In the US, teachers get 2/3 hours per year peer review. In Finland, 2/3 hours per week.
        *   Includes commenting on the work of others (constructively) on the blog
        *   teaching with others allows for critique, and ultimately improvement &#8230;
        *   &#8220;Great musicians will thank those who tear them to pieces&#8221; &#8211; taking & giving criticism are themselves hard skills
        *   Criticism must be constructive &#8211; tearing them to pieces gives the wrong message!
*   *Learning* is about building connections 
    *   The real story is complicated (see Patricia Benner&#8217;s work on nursing), but for our purposes, there are three levels: 
        *   Novice: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I don&#8217;t know&#8221; 
            *   Frequently level of scientists who come to SWC workshops
            *   copy-paste/repeat exactly instructions&#8230;frequently those attending SCW
        *   Competent: &#8220;I can apply the right rules correctly under normal circumstances&#8221;
        *   Expert: &#8220;I know when to break the rules&#8221; &#8211; see the world differently 
            *   Experts tend to be able to debug better than competents, because they can reason backwards
            *   But you forgot sohow to understand the thing (and explain simply): expert blind-spot
            *   Experts aren&#8217;t thinking faster, but are considering only the alternatives that are relevant
            *   getting to the point where your brain just recognises solutions, we are not aiming to create experts&#8230;we can get people from novices to competent (they can do normal things normally&#8230;).
        *   Two interesting experiments with chess novices and experts 
            *   memorizing pieces position for setup coming from real games or from random placements -> experts outperformed by novices in the random case
        *   Want to get people from novice to competent (producing experts is not SWC&#8217;s goal) 
            *   Takes less time
            *   They can get to expert themselves if needed
            *   The Tolstoy theory of learning: &#8220;people who understand, understand the same way; people who misunderstand misunderstand in original ways&#8221;. backed by research
            *   Easy to figure out student misconception if 1-on-1, but impossible for 40 or 400, this is where peer instuction can help (scales well!)
            *   Clear up their misconceptions, so they have the right framework to work from, and do more stuff
        *   Peer Instruction (best scalable instruction technique we have up to date) 
            *   put a multiple choice question on the board &#8211; eg which option fixes this buggy code?
            *   ask people to vote for answers
            *   have people explain/discuss the answers in small groups (3-4)
            *   then vote again (another round of discussion and you get to talk to the people again: most of the learning takes place in the 2nd round of discussion)
            *   Could be a good combination of expert (teacher) and competent (peers) teaching
        *   Applying this to coding practices??
        *   MOOC don&#8217;t work very well for novices, but work well as review for concepts 
            *   broadcast lecturing of any type (MOOC or sage on the stage) doesn&#8217;t work well for clearing up misconceptions.
        *   Difference (btw novice, competent, and expert) is partly volume of knowledge&#8230;
        *   &#8230;but strength and density of connections are actually more important 
            *   James Burke&#8217;s [*Connections*][4] is a great illustration
        *   the better you understand the topic the more connections between the facts&#8230;so fewer hops 
            *   We partly will give the facts, but also the connections, facts+connections=improved retention
            *   The more pointers to a fact in the brain, the more likely is is to be remembered (if no pointers, then purged) ; think about garbage collection
*   *Teaching* is about making new facts and connections digestible 
    *   How the brain learns under-constraints instructional design
    *   7 plus or minus 2 (number of facts short-term memory can hold at one time &#8211; Don&#8217;t overload!)
    *   45-90 minutes (brain gets tired at this point, murble murble murble) 
        *   But really 5-10 minutes blocks of information we absorb
        *   The recovery period is about 5 minutes, get air/oxygen, need to move (Twitter doesn&#8217;t count as a reset activity)
    *   Underrepresented groups more likely to go into an activity if they go into it with at least a few other people that they identify as being like them
    *   group sign ups might bring up more interactivity and ease than individuals that never meet each other in the room&#8230;unless it&#8217;s a technique they have used before&#8230;
    *   scientists not use to peer review in teaching&#8230;give and accept correction&#8230;
    *   organization target bootcamps: share interest, even better if in the same disciplines, more material and higher retention: focus more narrower on what that particular crowd needs&#8230;
    *   follow-up after bootcamp: bring many people from a lab to a scw will translate in easier implementation of what they learned vs a single individual&#8230;
    *   And many other factors that we&#8217;ll discuss later
    *   People talk to each other more if they know each other.
*   Round 1 
    *   Read the first two chapters of [*How Learning Works*][2] and [Mark Guzdial&#8217;s paper][5] 
        *   If you&#8217;re going to read one blog for this course, subscribe to http://teaching.software-carpentry.org
        *   But if you&#8217;re going to read a second, read Mark&#8217;s: http://computinged.wordpress.com/
    *   Pick a small topic related to what we teach here (something you think you could teach in 5 minutes) something a scientist with few computing skills would be interested in learning
    *   Create a concept map for it (&#8220;bubbles and arrows&#8221;)! 
        *   Half a dozen bubbles and a dozen arcs &#8211; does not commit us to an order which a bullet list would. But we don&#8217;t think in order&#8230;we think in connections.
        *   Lists are linear, vs a concept map where you can put things down, link them, and *then* think about the order to put them in (for sketching out writing papers)
    *   A picture of the ideas and how they connect, not of the thing you&#8217;re teaching 
        *   can be given to students before they&#8217;re being taught
        *   have students write them &#8211; as a feedback mechanism
    *   Low fidelity! 
        *   no fancy software tools, draw it freehand and quickly (Post a picture)
        *   makes people be more honest, if you use a low fidelity drawing you will get more honest feedback&#8230;cause the reviewer see this can be done faster and therefore hurt less the feelings of the sketcher&#8230;prototypes: make them quickly, get honest feedback. Concept map: visual hook for those learnin about what they are learning: reinforces too (making the connections explicitly).
    *   Invert concept maps: ask the learners draw them about what they learned (quick concept map on a post-it) &#8230;you&#8217;ll be able to see if they got it or not. Not scalable though (numbers), use end of the day/just before lunch.
    *   See [examples from past participants][6]
    *   Post it by Thursday Oct 17 in the categories &#8220;Round 7.1&#8243; and &#8220;Concept Map&#8221; 
        *   We use categories rather than tags
    *   Comment on at least two other people&#8217;s concept maps 
        *   Does it make sense?
        *   What&#8217;s missing?
        *   What&#8217;s there that shouldn&#8217;t be?
        *   Is it too large/too small?
    *   We&#8217;ll meet again on Thursday Oct 24th (if Greg&#8217;s teaching schedule permits)
*   Q&A 
    *   Coursera is good only if you&#8217;re already good at the subject (very bad for newcomers)
    *   70-90% of successful &#8220;completers&#8221; have a background in the area
