A quick concept map of the ls function on the command line, including a few reasons why someone might want to use it and a few of the very basic options for modifying its output.  I know there are tons more cool things that ls can do (eg ls + option aliases in the .profile are awesome), but I tried to restrain myself.  Looking forward to comments.[<img class="size-medium wp-image-4893 alignleft" title="Zimmerman ls concept map" alt="Zimmerman SWC ls mind map 7_1" src="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Zimmerman-SWC-ls-mind-map-7_1-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" />][1]
