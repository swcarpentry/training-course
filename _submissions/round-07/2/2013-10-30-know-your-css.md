Here are a couple of questions to distinguish knowledge levels in CSS.

Beginner v. Competent

A CSS rule without any precedence-modifying keywords located in which of these places has the highest precedence in setting a CSS property?

(a) In the CSS rule in the author stylesheet applying to the element&#8217;s class

(b) In the element&#8217;s inline style

(c) In the browser default for the page

(d) In In the CSS rule in the author stylesheet applying to the element&#8217;s ID

&nbsp;

Competent v. Expert

Here are some CSS rules and a DOM element containing some text.  What color will the text render?  No loading it in a browser until you&#8217;re done!

CSS rules:

div#myDiv{  
color:#FF0000;  
}

div.awesomeDivs{  
color:#00FF00 !important;  
}

div {  
color:#0000FF;  
}

DOM element:

<div id=&#8217;myDiv&#8217; class=&#8217;awesomeDivs&#8217; style=&#8217;color:#FF00FF&#8217;>What Color Is This Text?</div>

(a) #FF0000

(b) #00FF00

(c) #0000FF

(d) #FF00FF
