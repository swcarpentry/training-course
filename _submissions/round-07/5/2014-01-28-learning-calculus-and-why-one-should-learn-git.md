# Being Motivated to Learn Calculus

As part of my undergraduate degree, I was required to take higher level mathematics, either calculus or linear algebra. I had previously taken introductory calculus in high school, that consisted mainly in learning how to do derivatives of functions. Unfortunately, I tended to coast in high school, and my first year of university I did the same. I got a C in my first semester of calculus (differential calculus), and then a D in my second (integral calculus). I tried a different course, and recieved an F. This was my first (and thankfully my only) F in all of my school years. By this time I was in my third year, and was slowly starting to figure out how to study effectively. However, this class was required if I was to be awarded my degree in my chosen majors (biology and chemistry double major). So, I buckled down, and started truly trying to understand the material. I did the problems, and when I couldn&#8217;t figure them out, I went and got help. I asked questions, I worked with others in the class, and I kept trying, and trying, and really trying to understand the material. I finally finished that class with I think a B grade, and a much better understanding of why integrals, and calculus, is important.

# Personal Experience with Git

I do bioinformatics type research for a living, which necessarily means writing code, because I need code to do my analyses. As part of writing code, in the last year I have started heavily using the *git* revision control system. This past year, I was co-author on a publication about software that I had written. That software project is in a *git* repo, and I am very glad it is. The reviewers of my manuscript requested many changes to the underlying software package. Because I had it in *git*, I was able to create a new branch and start making requested changes, all without worrying about breaking the current codebase. Due to keeping the code on **GitHub**, I was also able to point to actual commits that address the reviewers concerns.

In addition, some of the reviewer&#8217;s points required writing entirely new analyses. As I worked on that, I needed to write over 500 lines of new functionality, as well as the new analyses. All of this went into the *git* repo, allowing me to keep track of progress, and easily revert or branch off as necessary when things went wrong. I don&#8217;t think I could have done the work that I did in a timely manner without version control.
