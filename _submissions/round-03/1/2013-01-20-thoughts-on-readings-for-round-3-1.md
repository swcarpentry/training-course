We were supposed to discuss the readings in Friday&#8217;s meeting, but we got distracted by other things and never got to it. I made a bunch of notes when I was reading, so I will inflict them on you now to get the conversation started. Please join in with a comment or a blog post of your own!

The readings were:

*   [The Bigger Issues in Learning to Code: Culture and Pedagogy][1]
*   [MOOCs are a fundamental misperception of how teaching works][2]
*   [Why Is It So Hard to Learn to Program?][3] (PDF)<hr width=40% /> 

I don&#8217;t have much to say about &#8220;Why Is It So Hard&#8221; apart from I am surprised that the ACM teaching associations are so new. I&#8217;m now less surprised that I didn&#8217;t learn anything in university&#8230;

It&#8217;s interesting that people are capable of specifying a complicated process for another person, but can&#8217;t make the leap to correctly specifying the process to a computer. Media Computation seems to provide the context which makes it possible for people to learn how to program, but Guzdial doesn&#8217;t connect the dots (probably because we don&#8217;t know) as to what changes in learners&#8217; thought processes when they&#8217;re taking Media Computation as opposed to a traditional CS1 course. Intuitively it seems obvious that if you can get learners to associate an abstract idea to a concrete concept that they already understand (pixels in an image, snippets of audio) then they will be able to learn it better.<hr width=40% /> 

Regarding &#8220;MOOCs are a fundamental misperception&#8221;, I wonder how many of the people who think MOOCs can replace university courses had a university experience that followed the MOOC model: lectures, assignments, exams, results, with very little one-on-one teaching or interaction. I know that&#8217;s what my university experience was like; I&#8217;m fairly sure I didn&#8217;t make any kind of impact on any professor, and I was bewildered by the few undergrads I knew who managed to establish relationships with profs.

On the question of motivation, Guzdial says &#8220;Our society depends on teachers who motivate students to persevere and learn&#8221;. But doesn&#8217;t signing up for a course mean that you&#8217;re motivated? If that motivation flags, is it the responsibility of the teacher to revive it, or the student? Isn&#8217;t the most we can ask of a teacher that they not destroy motivation?<hr width=40% /> 

I found the Pedagogy part of &#8220;The Bigger Issues&#8221; a little disheartening; that such a tiny difference in the way material was presented could make such a big difference in learner success! And the difference was not only tiny but not intuitively obvious. I mean, sure, subgoal labels are nice and all, but who would guess that they would make such a big difference? It&#8217;s disheartening because it seems like it would be impossible to be an &#8220;intuitively good&#8221; teacher &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t just think of something like this and know for sure that it would be so helpful. Maybe you could try something new every time you teach a course, but if you&#8217;re not a researcher you won&#8217;t have anything except one set of marks and your own gut to tell you if it worked.

(At least I think so &#8212; maybe to an experienced teacher it is intuitively obvious that something like subgoal labelling would work.)
