My take on generators in Python. I find it hard to fit in a page, maybe it&#8217;s a bit large. I don&#8217;t like much how crowded is the area to the left of the &#8220;iterators&#8221; box. Probably colors or using a larger sheet would help, but I made it rough, as Greg said, so you feel free to criticize <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
