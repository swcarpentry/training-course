I was inspired by my experience changing the .bash_profiles of many mac users at a SWC bootcamp as we worked through installation issues. I tried to explain what I was doing, but the process was very strange to many students, and I felt like I was giving the impression that you had to know deep internals of the operating system to do any scientific computing.

I wanted to do a concept map to explore just how many concepts are packed into the process of adding an export line to a .bash_profile. Perhaps this can help me explain it more clearly, and understand how it should fit into a bootcamp.<figure id="attachment_3039" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I think it could use somerevision, but for now, at least I&#8217;m making the rest of you all look good&#8212;not that you needed my help!
