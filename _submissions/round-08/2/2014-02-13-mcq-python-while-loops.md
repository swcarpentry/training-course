*Question to distinguish novices from competent practitioners before you start teaching:*

What do while-loops do?

1) Repeat a chunk of code a given number of times  
2) Repeat a chunk of code until a condition is true  
3) Repeat a chunk of code until a condition is false  
4) Repeat a chunk of code indefinitely

&nbsp;

*One multiple-choice question to tell whether your audience has actually learned what you set out to teach*

Which of these loops will not finish?

1) i = 1  
&emsp; while i <= 10:  
&emsp; &emsp; j = i * 3  
&emsp; &emsp; print j  
&emsp; &emsp; i = i + 2  
&nbsp;

2) i = 1  
&emsp; while i != 20:  
&emsp; &emsp; j = i * 5  
&emsp; &emsp; print j  
&emsp; &emsp; i = i + 2  
&nbsp;

3) i = 1  
&emsp; while True:  
&emsp; &emsp; j = i * 7  
&emsp; &emsp; print j  
&emsp; &emsp; break  
&emsp; &emsp; i = i + 2  
&nbsp;

4) i = 1  
&emsp; while True:  
&emsp; &emsp; j = i * 10  
&emsp; &emsp; print j  
&emsp; &emsp; i = i + 2  
&emsp; &emsp; if j == 20:  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; break  
&nbsp;

*One short practical exercise they could do to exercise their new knowledge*

Fill in the code as a while loop to print out the first 12 numbers in the 10 times table

while :  
&emsp; j = i * 10  
&emsp; print j
