This is aimed at someone learning the unix environment for the first time. &#8216;find&#8217; is one of those commands I use almost daily. I feel like this is too &#8220;flow diagram-y,&#8221; and had a hard time breaking the command into its concepts.

Agreed, this is a mess. Here&#8217;s my 2nd go at it. Trying to break how find works down to the 3 core principles: where to start looking, what you&#8217;re looking for, and what to do once you find it.
