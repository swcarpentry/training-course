Meeting of the Software Carpentry Instructors Study Group  
Round 4.3/4.4  
May 8/9, 2013

**Agenda**

*   How &#8220;science-y&#8221; did you think this research was?
*   Would you approve it if it was sent to you for peer review?
*   What did you read that you didn&#8217;t believe?
*   What (if anything) are you going to change in your own working practice?
*   What (if anything) are you going to teach?
*   How should the picture superiority effect (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture\_superiority\_effect) affect your slides?
*   See [<cite>Making Software</cite>][1] for more (and more recent) research

**Next Round**

We are moving our next meeting up a day to accommodate our Australian friends (or having a third meeting—we&#8217;ll figure it out next week). To prepare:

*   Look at [past videos][2]
*   Read [Chen&#8217;s pattern language of screencasting][3] and [Mayer on reducing cognitive load][4]
*   You may find other papers on the [reading list][5] interesting as well&#8230;
*   Record two short videos of yourself teaching something 
    *   One giving a lecture at a whiteboard
    *   One a screencast (record your desktop while you do something, explaining as you go)
*   Each one < 3 minutes each (hard limit, no exceptions)
*   Post to YouTube/Vimeo and add links to this blog post

**Notes from discussion**

*   Code review: 
    *   Setup projector, grade code never seen, and do review in front of audience
    *   let them see &#8220;how&#8221; you do the review.
    *   Will that enocurage them to do more reviews themeselves?
*   Teach to read before you write? 
    *   No! If you want to learn, you need to be committed.
    *   Students more attentive when doing a task that is useful to them
*   Presentations 
    *   more effective when you combine text with images
    *   lots of text = redundant information
    *   reduce cognitive load
    *   more text needed when it&#8217;s standalone
    *   having only images on a slide makes me present better, since I have nothing to read off of, and thus *need* to know what I&#8217;m saying
*   Feedback 
    *   video: great medium for getting feedbacking about teaching technique
    *   YouTube used to solocit feedback (musicians, and teachers)
    *   emphasis on &#8220;how you teach&#8221; not &#8220;what you teach&#8221;
