Please forgive my handwriting and drawing abilities. Pleas note that purposely limited myself to slicing of python lists to keep the diagram manageable.

Please comment. (should be scruffy enough)

When making this concept map I was surprised how many times I had to restart because I realized I had forgot some subtleties like copies & views. Of course slicing only makes sense if some kind of sequence is introduced / already know. I am not sure how much I need to really cover about lists or if constraining myself only to them is cheating.
