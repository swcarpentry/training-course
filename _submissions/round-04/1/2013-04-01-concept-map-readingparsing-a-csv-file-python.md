I&#8217;ll say that this was definitely more difficult than I thought it would be&#8230;especially just trying to decide how to come up with something that wasn&#8217;t a) already taken and b) not going to end up in a winding mess.

Because I&#8217;m late in completing this, I thought I&#8217;d go ahead and attempt to do it with crayons. Unfortunately, the closest thing I had was Crayola Colored Pencils, which is what I used.

I&#8217;d appreciate feedback, as reading/parsing a CSV file is a common task in the meteorology classes I&#8217;ve been a part of that teach computing skills.
