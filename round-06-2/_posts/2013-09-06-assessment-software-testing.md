This is a follow on from my Software Testing Concept Map

1) What is the difference between a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Test</span> and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Integration Test</span>?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  a) A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Test</span> checks that the entire code works, while a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Integration Test</span> checks that different parts of the code work together properly.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  b) A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Test</span> checks that the entire code works, while a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Integration Test</span> checks that the code interfaces with third party software properly.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  c) A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Integration Test</span> checks that the code builds properly on a given platform, while a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Test</span> checks that a code and any associated third party software work together properly.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  d) A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Integration Test</span> checks that the entire code works, while a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Test</span> checks that different parts of the code work together properly.
</p>

2) Which combinations of testing help accomplish Validation as opposed to Verification?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  a) a combination of unit, integration, and system testing
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  b) regression testing
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  c) none of these
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  d) system testing, system integration testing (if applicable), and regression testing.
</p>
